The following code is in effect immediately for the reporting of civil disorders and
other events that may reflect public tension in the WI'VD, Channel 11, coverage area.
When in doubt, contact management at once.

1. Avoid emphasizing stories on public tensions, while the tensions of a particular
incident are developing. Ask the law-enforcement agency involved whether the
developing incident is designated as a disturbance of the peace, or otherwise.
Report the official designation of the incident.

2. Public reports should not state exact location, intersection, street name, or
number until authorities have sufficient personnel on hand to maintain control. °

3. Immediate or direct reporting should minimize interpretation, eliminate airing
of rumors and avoid using unverified statements.

Avoid the reporting of trivial incidents. Reporting should emphasize the partial
and local aspects of the particular incident, avoiding implication that the incident
represents widespread or general events. Editing also should place the reporting
of the incident in realistic perspective.

5. Because inexpert use of cameras, bright lights or microphones may stir exhibi-
tionism of some people, great care should be exercised by crews at scenes of
public disorders. Because, too, the danger of injury to news personnel, their
presence should be as unobtrusive as possible. Unmarked vehicles should be
used for initial evaluation of events.

6. Cruising in an area of potential crisis in marked cars may invite trouble. Reporters
should make full use of law-enforcement headquarters nearest such an area until
a newsworthy event occurs.

/. Reporters at the scene of an explosive or potentially explosive situation should
avoid reporting of interviews with obvious "inciters". Reporters should interview
responsible representatives of the local elements involved, avoiding outside
antagonists.

8. Reporters should avoid scare headlines, scare bulletins, and sensationalism of
any kind.

9. No report should use superlatives or adjectives which might incite or enlarge a
conflict, or cause a renewal of trouble in areas where disturbances have quieted.

10. Reporterssnould emphasize efforts by law enforcement officials to restore order.
_ Advice to the public should emphasize avoidance of areas of potential danger,
observance of any curfew, or similar suggestions that originate with responsible
officials.

Advisory data for discretionary use by newsmen should be written in calm,
matter-of-fact sentences. This for the purpose of avoiding inflammatory results
from unintended public report of discretionary information. Honest and dis-
passionate reporting is the best reporting.

Reporters should not detail how any weapon is obtained, made or used.

Reporters should not identify precise locations of command posts of public officials,
police, fire units or military units.

Every reporter and cameraman should be governed by the rules of good taste and
common sense. The potential for inciting public disorders demands that competi-
tion be secondary to the cause of public safety.
