Sir:

It's a bit of a disgrace to use tear gas against
children who are aine to fourteen years of aze,
isn't it? Or did I mishear the news report?

Sincerely yours,

Dr. Herbert H. Blumberg
Assistant Professor of Psychology
Wilson College

Chambersburg, Pennsylvania

Dear Dr. Blumberg:

In the absence of Governor Moore from the State I am taking
this opportunity to acknowledge your letter relative to the use of
chemicals in the Hyde County situation.

In the situation in Hyde County a minimum of police force was
usedmand then only when considered to be necess to protect lives
and property. Chemicals have been used only n absolutely
necessary. And these chemicals did not caugé harmful effects to
individuals and were probably less harmful han physical force would
have been.

Parts of the report made to the Governor on the situation may be
ef interest to you. It states:

"At approximately 12:30 p.m. on Friday, November 8, 1968, about
150 Negroes assembled at the Welfare Office (which is an old two-story
house located two or three blocks east of the courthouse) in protest of a
letter that had been mailed by order of the State Welfare Office.
Sergeant Charles Smith received a call for Patrol assistance from Sheriff
Charles Cahoon at 12:40 p.m. He arrived at 1:20 p.m. and assieted the
sheriff in making several requests that the approximately 100 Negroes
which were inside the Welfare Building to vacate. After these several
requests by Mr. Bill Miller, Welfare Director, Sheriff Cahoon and
Sergeant Smith, the Negroes locked themselves into the building. One of
the county deputies broke the glass section of the storm door and threw
three cannisters of tear gas in the building. Sergeant Smith used Chemical
MACE by spraying through this broken window on some subjects that were
attempting to pick up the gas cannisters and throw them back out. The
crowd was dispersed from the building in short order.

we
nA

Sheet 2 Dr. Herbert H. Blumberg November 19, 1968

“The crowd milled around outside with several attempting to
re-enter the building. Sergeant Smith and Trooper Oders Boyd assisted
the Sheriff's Department in preventing re-entry by blocking the door. There
was no physical contacts by any of the officers and no arrests were made. "'

Best wishes.

Sincerely,

Charles Dunn

This is to acknowledge receipt of eee egram concerning the situation

In the meantime, I want to assure you that the Governor is concerned and

County working, in the first instance, to obtain acceptance among Negro students
of the HEW integration guidelines and, in the second instance, to assist local

We have requested written reports on the incidents which occurred last

Oral reports would indicate, however, that a minimum of force was used

property. The chemicals used in the disturbances did not cause harmful effects
to individuals, according to reports, and were probably less harmful than
physical force would have been. Arrests were made, according to information

My. coshua 3B. Zafman, Director
Information Division

Office of Civil Rights

Health, Bducation and ‘Yelfare Dept.

Ags you know, we have reeently had some cor-

respomience about civil Rights matters, vut not directly rel-
ative to the uarter, N. C. school situation now claiming
widespread attent in Eastern Carolina and Virginia.

This is of special interest to me, as a foimer resident
of North Carolina. “hile not a former reaj@ent of the Zastern
area of the state, I am closer now to thé

than ever before. Right at this very giinent Rov, Abernathy,
of the Southern Christian mevenent 28 there roughing {it a
and preparing to give all the t e he can. Of course, f

of matters where “angels $&

i matters come to my mind, I must ale
‘firet and fundamental causes of uf the

Ih6ols ever since Lay 17, 1954, when the areat
Justice darren handed down the most famous Civil Rights deeli-e
sion for the Supreme Court. For him to come in shortly pricr
to that desision and to have unanimous backing from the Court
in said desision, despite the many 4ifffrenees of opinion
throughout the at the time, was convincing to me that
there was a certain nm ty group back of it all with power
to overcome our government anf enforee whatever they willed,
despite the conselentious feeling of the vast ma jort of the
people. ‘e don’t have to adlite what has happened, and still
happening, since.

While we certainly have the right to eriticize, it is better

to have greater pity for those, it seems, who conseientiously
feel they should mix andi forge the two races to the ultimate
extinction of either and the amalgamationoof both. To those
who openly urge integration in our sehools, mixing socially andi

nore as they must, cont there is no hora to either race,

bat not seni their own children to mixed sehools or mix as
theg urge others to do, 1% must be sald they are guilty of the

vankest deceit. Those accused of bigotry anjprejuiive, are better,

because they are just what they are; they don’t wear two faces.
Your Department should settle the Swanquarter matter as the

good people there feel it ought to be.

Personally, I long to see the day when we can get baek to
education again, because it is indisputable that this generation
will be the least educated over the past 50 o3 more years. In
my last College teaching experienee, before interference in
the sehools by the supreme Court the Federal aduinistration,
the education of Freshmenrentering College then was bad cnough.
My observation and what I hear now convinees me that the poor
kids today can’t write, spell not think straight on most omi-
nary matters.

It would have been far better for the Supreme Court to have
said the races are equal and st there, leaving all matters
as to races, sohools, opportunities and wimt hve you, to the
states to work out on an equal basis. “hatever we may think or
say, matters could never have been worse. Therecnwould have been
more and better education, and integration could not have been
less. Government interference has created, 111 feeling, prejue
aise and a general standoff both as to whites and bilaeks, that
never would have oceurred,
