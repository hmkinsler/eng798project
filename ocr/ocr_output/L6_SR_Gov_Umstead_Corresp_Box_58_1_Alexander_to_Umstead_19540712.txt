Honorable William B. Umstead, roe ome
Governor of North Carolina, I LR
Raleigh, N. ¢. OrFiCE

Dear Governori-

I have noticed in the paper that you are contemplating a Committee or a
Commission to study the matter of segregation in North Carolina, particu-
larly as it pertains to schools.

In Halifax County we are in excess of 60% colored and particularly in
the agriaultural section of this county where we are close to 70%, we
are of course very much disturbed, and while I don't have the answer,

I feel that under your wise leadership that there are sufficient men in
North Carolina to devise some plan whereby the matter of mixing colored
and white children in white schools can be avoided, and I hope you will
permit me to suggest that on this Commission there be included men other
than educators who will work out a2 solution satisfactory to both the
white and colored population, and I therefore hope that you will search
the field in Eastern North Carolina for some good level-headed businessmen
to serve on this Committee.

In Halifax County we have made wonderful strides in the past six or seven
years towards equalizing facilities of the white and colored. We now have
in the county six negro high schools and six white high schools, and we

have a program which over the next few years will equalize the facilities.

I will be glad to sit with you if necessary in arriving at appointees of
this most important undertaking.

With kind personal regards, I am

Sincerely yours,

ER hb darrreke
