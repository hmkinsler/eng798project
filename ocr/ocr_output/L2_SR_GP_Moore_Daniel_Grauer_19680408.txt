The Honorable Governor Dan Moore
State Capitol
Raleigh, North Carolina

Dear Sir:

Let us be fair! Let us give ALL Americans an equal opportunity,
Let us all work together to provide decent housing, have open housing
and do everything within our power to foster respect and dignity for
ALL Americans regardless of their color,

On the other hand, violence on the part of anyone should NOT be
tolerated, but hollow calls for law and order from the white community
while they are doing relatively nothing to change the horrible plight
of the Negro American are stupid and border on the criminal, Let us,
in North Carolina, enforce the laws fairly but work to educate and change
the plight, particularly of the children, born into a life in which they
are doomed to poverty and ignorance,

Thank you, Governor Moore, for anything and everything you are
attempting to do, Let us know if we can be of help in any way,
