Dear Governor Moore:

As a member of one of the Charlotte Churches sending 4a telegram requesting
passage of Civil Fight legislation including Open Housings, I would like to
state that I am opposed to the Open Housing Bill. I am also opposed to
voting on passage of any Civil Rights lesislation until rioting, looting,
and lawlessness come to a halt.

The legislative branch of our government has an awesome responsibility to
weich wisely and conscientiously the passage of laws affecting all

citizens and this should not take place during a wave of extreme emotionalisr,
as is now present foltowing the tragic assassination of Dr. Martin Luther
King, or any «her national figure.

In the telegram sent this week it is stated that these people have been
previously silent and left legislation to extreme elements, and that they
now feel compelled to speak on the subject of human dignity, decency, ani
freedom. The Church is a place of worship and for mourning the death c*
individuals, not a place for politics and sudden emotional involvement in
lawemaking. If these same people who signed the telegram so to the polls
on election day and make their choices known after careful consideration of
each candidate, then they can feel free to write their representatives and
make their wishes known in a sincere and rational way.

Sincerely

yours,

(Mrs. John M.) Lura K. Kester
