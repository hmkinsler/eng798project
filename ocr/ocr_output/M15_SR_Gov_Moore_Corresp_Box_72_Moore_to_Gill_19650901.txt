MEMORANDUM
TO: Mr. Gill
FROM: Governor Moore

oe

I think in the newsconference toyriox row we show have a strong
statement depi-rcing the activities of both the Klan, which Sifters nothing
constructive for the good of North Caroljaa, and the extremists in the civil
rights movement, who seem to be seeking publicity ove® a completely superfluous
issue--that of voter registration. + f

It should state that every citizen will Pe given an opportunity to
register under the State law and/the Federal Registiation Act beginning October 3
and that both these groups, bg geeming to seek :ae collision between the groups,
are simply encouraging lawles sness and violence and are damaging the good
reputation of North Carolina and that this can only hurt the State in its efforts to
provide better jobs and better job opportunityes for our citizens which are so
badly needed to raise the per capita income of all our people.

We shauld congratulate the great majority of our citizens of both
races who are meeting the challenge of changing times and conditions with a
spirit of understanding and tolerance and who believe in upholding the law of our
State. The statement should add that we are confident that the good judgment of
the citizens of North Carolina will prevail and that only violence will be the
result of the misguided efforts of a few extremists on both sides and that the State
will continue to offer aid to all local law enforcement officers where needed to
prevent such acts on the part of these individuals, It should add that we call upon
all the citizens of our State to assist in the effort to maintain North Carolina
tradition of good government and respect for law and order.
Mr. Gill “2 September 1, 1965

We might also add something to the effect that the integration of
our schools is proceeding in an orderly manner and that no incidents of violence
have been reported. It should state that the actions of the two groups in Plymouth
are particularly unfortunate at this time when we are striving to maintain an
orderly procesa in the field of education.

I would appreciate it if you would formulate such a statement so
that we may have it available tomorrow,

DM:adl
