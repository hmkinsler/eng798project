Near Chier Justices

T aw a concerne? and most dittressed mother of Pour childven agec
16 4, ® and 7 months old, therefore they attend senior hich, junior
hich and slenentry scnools,

T am referrine to the Suvreme Court dacision on "bucsizng" made on
Tueeday Arril 20, 1971, headed of course by you. Uave you or do you
care to hear the feelings of the cownen neople lite rgsels whe heve
children actendine public schools concerning Youssing"?

Let me make one point cleer. Just because. A Live in North Carolina
deesn’ t mean I'm against integration. For ingtance, when our children
become sick at scrool, we naturally “ave te fo sick them up. How neny
chilcren in the roorer arese Lave varents yho can afford to come ¢et
their children? Also, nowadaye children are engarced in extre activities
after school and this mazas one thing; Life oarents travaling Sach an?
forth. answer thie one, who is going ub vay for buses? Thie money
should be used to better and enlarre over crowded echocle.

Tt seens ezoparent to me end every other ve rson Trive talked with that
you are dicteted to anc nozsioly being threatensd py a hendful or NAACT*

Communists and liberals. Its the ton people in office today that is teering

our nation and ewer other nation apert. [te not wiat the citizens want

and need, its always what the ton tress wants to dictate. “%o you call this

Freedom? Po you cal) tris Sreedom thet my children cannot attend the
echool of their choice?

Have you ever talks? with children in public schocls if they want to
leave their friends ané seighborhocd? I hava taled with my three school
age children and they say "no".

tT think the time nes cone that Lssucs sucn as this one snould be
brought to the sublic to vote on. Then we would heve freadom to vote for
our wants and needs, This is the only honest and fair way.

No you have grandchildren whe abttmnd oublie schools cr Jo they attend

orivate schools? Believe me, this decision is on the liocs of everyone I
ND

know who has children and dominates scvar-tho-fence conversations at this
time. Pight is right and wrong is wrong and in ny »xergonal ovinion this
action if wrons as wrong can nossibly oe,

Ne you honestly and teuly feel you have a cloarm conscienca in your
decision on "bussing"?

Thimk about it.
