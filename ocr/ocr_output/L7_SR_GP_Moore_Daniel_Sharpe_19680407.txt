/e commend the law enforcement a,encies of Greensboro
for those policies which have, thus far, prevented any loss
of life in our present crisis.

However, because the presence of the armed National Gu.rd
heightens tension and provides a turget for violence which
might not otherwise occur, increasing the danger to human life,

Because the existence of the National Guurd as a riot
suppressor and the emphasis upon law and enforced order
contrast so harshly with the minizal attention being paid
to solutions for huwan needs, increasing the feelings of
frustration and helplessness emong the poor,

Because there can be no military solution to urban
probleus,

we seek the imuediate instigation of social and econo.nic
progra.s to improve the conditions of housing, education, and
enployment among tne poor,

We volunteer our cooperation and support for such prograns.
