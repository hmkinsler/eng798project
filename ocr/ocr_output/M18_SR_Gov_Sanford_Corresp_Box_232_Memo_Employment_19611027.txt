Governor Sanford: |

We consider it a very high honor to bé given this opportunity
to meet with you and words are inadequate to express our sincere
and deep appreciation. . ,

Permit me to say, we appreciate your dedicated, able and
inspiring leadership and it is our opinion that you have an appreci-
ation for the struggle the Negro is malting in this svate for
equaiity of opportunity for all.

There exists in North Carolina racial discrimination in
employment. In industry and government Negroes are not employed on
an equal basis with other citizens. Certainly, no form of racial
discrimination should be permitted to stand in the path to prevent
Negro workers from taking their place, upon a basis of equality,
merit and ability, in our expanding economy. An examination of the
status of Negro workers in state government clearly substantiates

the fact that the State of North Carolina is not making full use of

the individual Negro's talents and abilities. We urge you on this
occasion to think seriously and use the influence of your public
office to eliminate ciscrimination in government employment. North
Carolina does not have a fair employment practice law in relation
to government einolcyment but we feel that action by the Governor to
eradicate racial discrimination from all state-supported programs,
activities, agencies, and departments, will give the Negro an equal
chance to develop and utilize his talents and to enjoy the rewards
of his efforts. Action by the Governor will assure the Negro an
equality of treatment consistent with the principles of democracy
which we profess, and will display an effort on the part of the
highest official in the State of North Carolina that it is possible
to equalize job opportunity by governme.:ital action and contribute
to the elimination of the influence of prejudice in employment.

We firmly believe that "now is the time" for a program of
equality of opportunity in government employment to be effectively
implemented. We feel you are in a position to take the necessary
steps to change the policy and procedure of all state agencies and
departments from discriminatory practices to a policy of
non-discrimination in the hiring, appointment, assignment, and in
cases where Negroes are employed, the promotion of all personnel.

We request and urge you, Governor Sanford, to do something
about the systematic exclusion of qualified Negroes from certain

job classifications in state government solely because of their
Presentation to Governor Sanford =r

color.

We have observed that exclusion of Negroes in the process of
hiring is effected in various ways, by newspaper advertisements
requesting only whites to apply, by application blanks or forms on
which space is reserved for race, by discriminatory .ob orders
placed with employment agencies, or by the arbitrary policy of a
pers.nnel director, department supervisor or an official in charge
of hiring.

We don't think this state can afford to waste manpower at
this time, but we are wasting it. Discrimination in employment is
a waste. When a qualified Negro is unable to assume his rightful
place in state government employment because of his color, the
economy suffers. His skill, whatever it may be, is not utilized;
his education and training are wasted; and, because he cannot earn,
he cannot consume the economy's goods. We are losing many qualified
Negroes to other states because of economic discrimination.

When jobs are withheld from the Negro, he is forced to a lower
economic level, to a lower level of health, housing and education.

There are some people, Governor, who contend that the economic
condition of the Negro cannot be improved, changed or alleviated

tv

except by education and persuasion. We agree that these factors are
esscntial and are useful techniques and effective tools for the
elimination of discrimination in the employment field. However,

they are not sufficient.
Presentation to Governor Sanford oh

We say very clearly, that intolerance or prejudice is a state
of mind which laws cannot reach. Discrimination in government em-
ployment, such as denying a qualified man the right to earn a
living, 1s a separate matter which you, as Governor, certainly can
effectively regulate.

Governor Sanford, the manner in which government itself be-
haves in the employment area, has a large educational effect upon
all people everywhere. Its practices, therefore, will be the most
useful and persuasive example of what should be and can be done in
many areas of the employment field. But beyond mere example,
government directly organized, sets the pattern of much more of our
lives than we realize. We go to government owned and operated
public schools in childhood. We use public recreational facilities.
Many of us live in houses owned or financed by government. The
basic circumstances of much of our living are directly controlled
by government. You may not agree, but it is our opinion that the
armed services, the public schools, our nationwide housing projects,
all such organizations and institutions, are tremendous sociological
forces. It doesn't matter whether we wish it so or not. The think-
ing and acting of millions of human beings are profoundly influenced
by cone circumstances of their living aiiz association in these govern-
men™ controlled relationships. When people deny that these govern-
mental activities are “sociological laboratories", they are really

voicing a desire to use them to perpetuate or strengthen certain
Presentation to Governor Sanford ~5-

patterns of living and thinking, and an objection to their use to
develop other patterns. It is our belief that if all public or
governmental institutions and activities, Federal, state and local,
were conducted on a wholly non-discriminatory basis for five years,
the evils of racism would cease to become a major problem in the
State of North Carolina.

The continuing economic crisis for Negroes in the State of
North Carolina requires vigorous and rapid action by you, Governor
Sanford, to effectuate a program of non-discrimination as to state
government employment.

We call upon you, Goverror, with che power invested in you, to
alter the discriminatory employment practices in state government
and make it possible for qualified Negroes to be employed on an
equal basis with other citizens.

Governor Sanford, there is another matter in reference to
employment we do hope can be corrected. We refer to discrimination
in State Employment Services. There is a rigid pattern of racial
segregation and discrimination existing. Separate white and Negro
sections, which accept racially designated job orders from employers
and make job referrals of workers on a racial basis.

Negroes using the various state employment services are re-
ferred only to "colored jobs" and are denied access to employment
and training in the most desirable job opportunities.

We call upon you, Governor, to correct this evil and not allow
Presentation to Governor Sanford ~H=

discrimination as to the administration of state employment services.

We also urge you to make available more and better job opportunities

for Negroes within the state employment services.

We also urge you, Governor, to assist in eliminating discrimi-
natory restrictions in technical and industrial training programs.
There should be no state apprentice training program which excludes
qualified Negroes. Negro young people should be given every op-
portunity to develop their talents and skills on an equal basis with
other citizens.

We would like to say that Negro young people making career
choices are normally guided by whether “hey see others of their race
in a certain job category. This should not be the case. Rather
they should be guided by their own job interest. Their race should
be no barrier to getting a job, once they are qualified.

Should there be a total war, our manpower resources must be
expanded and this country will need the maximum use of all qualified
citizens. Permit us to bring to your attention,

N. C. Statute 127-2. COMPOSITION OF THE NATIONAL GUARD - The
National Guard shall consist of the regularly enlisted militia
between the ages of 17 and 45 years, organized, armed, and
equipped as hereinafter provided, and of commissioned officers
between the ages of 18 and 62 years.
and

N. C. Statute 127-6. WHITE AND COLORED ENROLLED SEPARATELY — The
white and colored militia shall be separately enrolled, and
shall never be compelled to serve in the same organizations.

No organization of colored troops shall be permitted where
white troops are available, and while permitted to be orga-

nized, colored troops shall be under the command of a white
officer.
Presentation to Governor Sanford ~7a=

We would highly appreciate your securing an advisory opinion
from the Attorney General and an advisory opinion from the Supreme
Court of the State of North Carolina, to determine the corstitu-
tionality of Section 127-6.

We would also appreciate your creating a state policy that
applications for work or employment in the State Hir’way Patrol be
processed without using race as a critc ia, and that the same policy
be employed by each department of the state government.

It is interesting to note that Mr. Gene Roberts, Jr., ina
series of articles, examined the employment problems in North
Carolina, and in his article on Monday, Septermber 4, 1961, stated
the following:

"State government employment, like the positions in private
industry, is also largely closed to Negroes. Out of the more than
7,000 jobs in Raleigh's "Capitol Square"area, there are less than
two dozen Negroes who hold jobs above the rank of janitor and mes-
senger.

"There are three Negro secretaries serving one Negro Welfare
Department administrator and seven Negro education supervisors in
the Department of Public Instruction.

"State Prision Department headquarters employs three Negroes—
& rehaoilitation supervisor, a chaplain and a prison recreation
assistant.

"Negro employment opportunities are limited in State government

outside of Raleigh, but not as severely as in the State administra-
Presentation to Governor Sanford ~8-

tive offices. The Probation Commission has three probation cefficers;
the State Alcoholic Beverage Control Board has eight Negro investi-
gators, and Negro mental institutions are heavily staffed with
Negroes.

"There are also Negro positions in Highway Department main-
tenance and truck crews and with the State Health De.crtment labora-
tori:s and dental hygiene teams. The {saute prisons system which has
more: Negro inmates than white, has eight Negro guards and five Negro
matrons in a total euard force of 1,249.

"Other Negro prison jobs are confined to an all-Negro unit in
Guilford County and a Negro youth center in Goldsboro."

The article stated that William R. Henderson, who heads the
Conservation and Development Department's industrialization program,
said, "until we find adequate income for all of our people we are
not going to enjoy a good per capita income in the State." Hender-
son noted that North Carolina ranks 43rd among the nation's 50 States

in per capita income.

We cannot afford to figure minorities according to the popu-
lation of a community, or a single state, or even a great nation.
In a world in which man-made satellites are orbited, in which
destructive missiles can be sent by push-button from continent to
convinent, we can afford to figure minovities and majorities in no
ares smaller than the earth itself.

We say to you on this day that if freedom is to survive ina

world in which peace can be secure, we must win the struggle for
Presentation to Governor Sanford ~Qu

the minds and hearts of men by demonstrating that the demecratic
way of life is the best in the world and that our way of life is
better than communism. We must demonstrate, in terms that have
meaning for all, the difference between our philosorhy anc that of
communism with regard of the worth of every human heing and now
those differences affect our way of life, In the field of human
relations, we must not only deciare we believe in equality of op-
portunity, but demonstrate our superiority by living up to our

ideals of equality.

Governor Sanford, we want to thank you for taking time out

of your busy schedule to discuss these matters with us.

Respectfully submitted,
