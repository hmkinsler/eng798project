Dear Governor Moore,

As you know, the homes of Kelly alexander, Fred slexéndcer,
Tulius Chambers and Dr. Rk. A, Hawkins were bomped early on

/

November 22, 1965.

Ne are aware of your concemnation of the bombing ana that
the State Investigetion Bureau end the Highway Patrol were
ordered to find the quilty vcarties., However, we feel thet some
safequards must be mace to vrevent a recurrence. Useless ce-
struction of oroverty is indeed an evil act énd only a miracle
orevented the senseless loss of human life. American citizens
do vossess the riacht to sleeov et nicht without fear of night
attecks,.

We urde vou to continue to press for information leéding
to the errest of these criminals, evcn if it meens that vour state
law enforcement officials have to work night and day. Fhe vour-
suit of justice knows no night or day, justice should alwévs
be at work.

The Lakeview NAACP anc indeed all of 4mevic# is waiting to |
reac in the newsnavers, to heér on the redio, to see on television
thet the verpnetretors nave been avrehended, brought to justice
and received the kind of sentence commensurate to their crime.

pincerely yours,
Executive Board
Lekeview NAACE
