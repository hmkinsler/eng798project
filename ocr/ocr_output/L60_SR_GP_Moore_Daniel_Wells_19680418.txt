The Honorable Dan K. Moore
Governor of North Carolina
Raleigh, North Carolina

My dear Governor Moore:

The past week in North Carolina and throughout our Nation has
been, to say the least, a trying time for all persons especially
those charged with the responsibility of maintaining law and order.

I feel that you would be interested in knowing that Washington
had some minor problems, and at times seemed as if we would have
problems to a greater degree. We called your office on the after-
noon of April 6, 1968, at which time we talked with Mr. Ragsdale and
Mr. Hodges. We advised them of the situation in Washington and
doublechecked the procedure for receiving assistance, should circum-
Stances warrant this request. I called your office at approximately
1:00 A. M. April 7, 1968, and advised Mr. Dunn and Mr. Hodges of the
Situation in Washington. I advised them that we were not requesting
assistance, but was passing on information and was seeking assurance
that should we need assistance we could receive it through your
office. It was reassuring to hear Mr. Dunn and Mr. Hodges say that,
should we need assistance, all that would be necessary for us to do
was telephone his office. They would in turn contact the local
National Guard Headquarters, afterwhich depending upon the local
National Guard officers' recommendations, assistance would be dis-
patched immediately.

I realize that your office, mine, and others in government exist
for the soul purpose of serving those citizens living within our
governmental units. I also realize that responsibilities can be
carried out with different degrees of enthusiasm. I am saying that
I greatly appreciate the courtesies which the members of your staff
extended to us and the manner in which they conducted the business
of your office while we were communicating with them,
Governor Moore Page two Aprill8, 1968

I hope that the situation never arises where we will actually have
to call upon your office for assistance in order to maintain law and
order, but should this event occur, I hope that your assistants will
handle it in the same manner as they did this past week.

Sincerely,
Wilfred A. Wells
City Manager
