Sovernor van K. Moore
Governor's Residence
Raleizth, I. oc.

Jear SJovernor E.-ore:

I would like to bring to ‘cur person:1 attention a rlan that migat
possibly prevent, in tie future, much of the rioting and lootinz to wach our
peorle have be.n subjected recentl-. To implement this plan, if merit is s-en
in it, no doubt will reeuire action bs ‘cur oifice, and possibly on a federal
level. Therefore, I nove cu mar: sce fit to tive it sericus thougiut.

Let noticus be cnclosed with welfare checks -nd unem-lovment bencfit
checks advising that if recipitent is apprehenacd wile entaging in « riot or
insurrection th:t it me be re:son to ageny future benerits. and, in the ease of
denenient c.ildren of welfere familics so apprenended, let these families be put
on notice that failure b: parent or guardien to restriin their children from en-
eeping in such attacks azainst the very societ, furnis:.ing tnem a livelilcod, may
be reason to susrend future benefits.

The steve now is emncwered to suspend or revoke a driver's license if
the person nolding such a license enudaneers the lives and property of other citizens
on our hiehwe.s, even ticuvh the Loss of this license may mean less of < job. And,
in certain cases, riotiny end lootine can mean loss of citizenstip upon conviction.
So, unle-s a welfere check is now sacrosanct, or has beccme more precious than
citizenship, I am of the orinion tiet families d=-pendent upon our society for a
livei.ood would ce:se their cttccks, if viven such an economic incentive to do SO.

Sinze the onl elternative seems to re bv, roree of arms, I hoe ‘ou se
merit in my suvvrestion and can device x mesns to implement it.

Thank -ou for your consideration.

Respectfully,

April 18, 1968
