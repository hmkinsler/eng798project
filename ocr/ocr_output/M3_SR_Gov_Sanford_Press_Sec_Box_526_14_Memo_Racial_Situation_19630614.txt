MEMORANDUM TO: Colonel David T. Lambert
Commanding

Raleigh, North Carolina

Attention:

Major C. Raymond Williems
SUBJECT: Racial Situation, Fayetteville, 13 June 1963

1. The following report was made to this office by Sergeant R. F.
Williamson:

Demonstrators from Fayetteville State Teachers College began
demonstrations today at 4:00 P.M.. Approximately 300 students

were involved in this demonstration. At approximately 4:00 P.M.

a "team" of approximately 16 students stationed themselves at

the Carolina Soda Shop which is located on Hay Street next to the
Carolina Theater. Others were at the theaters, except the Miracle
which has a reo eraaneng order to show cause, eto., and at restaurants.
At approximately 4:05 P.M., Mrs. Bill Crawley came out of the soda —
shop to gather up papers which were left beside the Soda Shop and
adjacent to the sidewalks. It is alleged that as she started to
pick up the papers a Negro female demonstrator pushed her and as
Mrs. Crawley raised up, she pushed back the demonstrator. The
demonstrator is alleged to have slapped Mrs. Crawley in the face
after the pushing incident. Mrs. Crawley is approximately 48

years of age. This incident was witnessed by Captain Melvin of

the Fayetteville Police Department. Captain Melvin "grabbed" the
girl to place her under arrest and at tris time another male
demonstrator, Willis Mcheod, Fayetteville Teachers College and a
native of Dillon, South Carolina, grabbed Captain Melvin by the
arm. This was witnessed by two police officers who immediately
grabbed McLeod and placed him under arrest for assault and resisting

arrest. McLeod y *noluding this arrest, has been arrested three times.
He is supposed ¢ be the leader of the demonstrators. The female

demonstrator was also arrested for assault. The two were taken

to the City Hall. while they were being processed, the
demonstrators began a march down Hay Street, picking up
demonstrators along the route. When they arrived at City
Hall, all were present. Upon arrival at City Hall, they lined
the sidewalks in front of the building on Green Street and
around the side to the entrance of tne Folice Station. They
chanted and sang their usual songs.

After approximately one hour at City Hall, they marched to a
nearby Church where a meeting was held. They came baok on

Hay Street at approximately 7:00 P.M. and began their demon-
strations at all restaurants on Hay Street, the Carolina Soda
Shop included, and all the theaters except the Miracle. In

the meantime, a large number of white people began to line

the street, especially near the corner where the Carolina

soda Shop is located. At approximately 7:30 F.M., some unknown
subject threw a tear gas bomb (U. S. Army type) into the demon-
strators causing them to become disorganized at this location.
The demonstrators began to run down the street (Hay Street).

As they picked up other demonstrators along the way, it seems

to me that they became a "mob". They have usually traveled

two abreast but they were taking up most of the sidewalks on this
occasion causing other people to move out of the path. This infor-
mation was given to me by Captain McLaurin.

There were 18 arrests and 20 charges which are as follows

Assault - 7

Assault and resisting arrest - l

State Fire Law Violation - 8 (blocking exits to public buildings -
 di.e., at restaurants)

Interfering with an officer - l

Three charges of assault on an officer were made because of the
following incident:

It seems tnat the demonstrators bumped into a police officer.
The officer told them he had a right to be there; that he wae

on duty, etc.. The demonstrators came back and three bumped

him - one behind the other. He caught one by the arm and two
other officers caught the other two. I do not know at thie time
the facts concerning the other arrests.

One subject was arrested at tne Donut Shop on the Boulevard. Some
demonstrators stopped there and were served; however, a larger group
care pte ent ees ponagement asked toen + leave and called the

, e police arrive subije
and was arrested for speeding stop at r vote toh and 13 oni ne
and loafing. He was one of he demons rators.

Attention: Major C. Kaymond wWiiliams

4 Lerge number ol white people were on Hay Street during the
Cemonstrations. Seversai "gangs" were observed ranging from
20 to 430 years of age. ‘Tney diaz not get out of line; however,
their presence was a constant concern to the police. Most of
the people were curious ena cbserving. The street was filied
witn heavy traffic until 9::0 ¢r.K..

i arrived at tre Police Stauilicn at approximately 9:45 F.M..
Atproximately 25 people were at and near tne station. i's

Negices were making bonds and leaving for enother meetirg callea
after tne gassing inclicent. I de not know, nor does the ysolice,
7 what their plans are for tomorrow. It is generally agreed that
, they ere "stirred up", and it 1g my opinion that tonight the
leanersr:ip or the movement was lost to a "mob". One reason for
: this opinion is because L. 8. Garris, a leader in this movement
‘ end Dr. Allen's gon, was making bonds for all the demonstrators.
w L. E. Garris is an undertaxer here in Fayetteville. He refused
- to sign McLeod's bond and at this time (11:30 P.M.) McLeod is

still in jail. Garris said, according to Captain McLaurin,

| that McLeod had to go: tnat he did not approve of his actions, etc..

@
+ Carytain McLaurin advised me that the leaders of this movement had
cal.ed tne *.B.1. in Charlotte and reported police brutality by
$ members of tne Fayetteville Police Department. Captain McLaurin
. stated that tre F.3.1. nad observed ali demonstrations in
. rayetteville and were observing cemcnstrations on this day. He

. denied that tnere has been any police brutality since the novement
bevyan. It was ulso stated that a group of these leaders met with
official3 ut Pope Field on 13 June and reported mishaviour by
Military Police assigned to the wayetteville areu. Tne leaders

a alieged tnet the Military Police were molesting the giri demon-

_ Strators und requestea that Fayetteville be placed "Off Limits"

for ull military personnel. No action hus been taken on this complaint.
Most restaurent owners on Hay Street are getting restraining orders
7 drawn up by their attorneys and I understand that they will be

' served, pogsibly teday, or. the damonstrators. ‘Thie is an effort to
relieve the plowxetine at their places ot business. This was done
alter the success o/ tne restraining order signed by Judge Mallard
against picketing st tne Miracle Theater. Since that time, no one
has plcoxeted the Miracle Theater.

ae

Sheriff Clark and Captain iicLaurlin were in the Police Station and

in conference. They invited me in ana Captain McLaurin stated

Chief Worrell lad asked him to contact the Patrol and have the

Patroi alert the men in this area for tomorrow. I advised

: Captain McLaurin that the Folice and the Sheriff had to exhaust

“* all their means before we woula be allowed to come in to Fayetteville.

veople woo operate their businesses on Hay Street. (It was obvious
that Sheriry Ciurk'ts views on enforcement during tne demonstrations
are contrary vo tne manner in wnicn toe city has been operating.

For instance, today the voiice were instructed not to maxe or to
ailow anyone to Sigu 2 warrant for treepass. sher:fr Clark insists
trat his County Attorney and Judge Mallard nave instructed nim to

I persunally do not know how to measure the tension which exists in
Fayetteville. Most or tne vecple I saw and talked with after the
demonstrétion were orderiy. If tne tension is high - which Sneriff
Clark and Cantain McLaurin indicates -~ it la because of the slapping
trncident involving Mrs. Bill Crawley. It seems that the demonstratcre
are determined to picket the Carolina Soda Shor. Mr. Crawley nas been
Cperating tre business for approximately 4U0 years and I remember that
18 or 9 years ago Mr. Crawley nad trouble with a Negre at his busi-
ness and Mr. crawley was seriously stabbed by tne Negro and almost
dieaq. Mr. and Mrs. Crawley are determined, and 81x arrests have been
made at tnis place this week. Mr. Crawley is rather popular with

the townsfcik, anda years ago he did have a nigh temper.

The slapping incident got out of proportion after making the rounds.
Many people were saying tnat she was slapped by a man, slapped, and
xicked, etc... This, in my opinion, caused the tension and tne gas-
throwlne incident.
