Dear Governor Moore,

I know you are a very busy man, so my feelings will not be
hurt if you don't have time to reply to this letter. Just wanted
you to know about the feeble efforts of a small man in a small
town to promote peace and goodwill in this great State which is
so fortunate to have you for its Governor.

Sincerely yours,

William CalvinAljames

To The Editor Cf The Winston-Salear Journa!:
X\ REASON TO BE SAD, BUT NO REASON TO RIOT, BURN, END LOOT:

Many compliments have been bestowec upon the late Dr. Martin
Lutner King since his assasination last week. I dare not ask tne
editor of this paper to list all of his :chle characteristics aqa.n,
but T am grateful for the privilege to mention his desire for love
to reign over hatred, and peace te triumpl. over violence.

Many of us question the methods and tactics Dr. King used t»
nelp mankind, but thousands upon thousancs cf people throuchcut the
world have admitted that his motive was acod. The many thi:.acs said
abeut his determination to overcome evil with good tell us that he
a man who worked on het issues with a cool head.

Martin Luther King, Jr. had the idea that all men should }e the
recipients of justice and freedom, but h: also had the idea th t no
man should seek after his rights with methods that are not riqa't
(ricting, burning, looting, fighting and killing). Througheut the
land he taught men to lay aside the weapons of violence and strive
for their goals with a more excellent way.

Ur. King used many opportunities to practice what he preached.
Wher a crowd of angry negroes (his race and my race too) gathered
tc retaliate for the bombing of his home in Montgemery, Alabama, -
Or. King persuaded his people to return to their homes and let peace
aLide in their hearts. His plea for restraint and order carried the
message: THIS EVIL DEED GIVES US NO REASON TO RESORT TO VIOLENCE.

The assaSination of Martin Luther King, Jr. bombed the negro
race. All of us feel the effect in one way or another, but I think
we need to repeat the message he proclaimed in Montaomery: THIS EVIL
DEED GIVES US NO REASON TO RESORT TO VIOLENCE.

Shame is upon those who used Dr. King's death for an excuse to
ijet, burn, and loot. Those who rencerec such violence took advantage
of a sad occasion to display the hatred that was already planted in
their hearts. They have admitted tc the world that the doctrine of
love which Dr. King upheld had no influence on their lives.

Men of all races who delikerately injure the economic, civil,
social, physical, or spiritual welfare of their fellow men - admit to
the world that they have rejected the example of Him who was greater
thar Martin Luther King, Jr. Jesus Christ was that greater one who
agave the perfect example as He marched along the shores of Galilee.

His followers heard Him say: ".....thou ehilt love thu netghbour as
moe EPP Ee our enemres", and "...ae ve would that men should
ne YOU, cs ye alse to them Litectse"., Cruel men misunderstood His

example, hated His doctrine, anc nailed Him to a cross. His prayer
on that rugged cross at Calvary tells us that He refused to hate those
who hated Him: "Father, forgive ther; for trey know nat what they da",
