Dear sovernor:=

From readinz the headlines and sub-
headings of our nevsynavers and listenins to T-V and
Radio these days it would seem that Law and Ordes’ ™
has simply disanpeired--one would think that the .
"hivther uns" are turninz their heads "the other way"
rather than loo it whats zoins on.

Fayetteville j3tate College Students
"Take over school" and then vive their DEMANDS of
whit must hanven before the vill in turn zive the
schoo: back to authorities---- ‘Jovernor, is there
no longer 2 word known as -Discipline ---couldn't
those students sinvly be expelled fron the school ?
are we Sinvly to turn everythin- ower to Hoodlums ?

Have ve become officials with sxine-
less body's do we no longer have the GUTS to take
a hand and stop this senseless takin= over thinzss
such as above ? How much longer shall we use the
Slan on the wrist rather th:n Somethins much stronger.

I sincerely hove our officials awaxe

before its too late. 7
