REPORT!

INSURRECTION CITY

@ ON ASSIGNMENT in the nation’s
capital for THe Review oF THE
News, your reporter spent last week
as a ragged resident of Resurrection
City, the so-called “City of Hope”
on the banks of the Potomac. My
editor had sent me to pose as one
of the “poor” in order to get a first-
hand account of the Poor People’s
Campaign encamped in the heart of
the District of Columbia.

When I arrived, sporting a two-
weeks’ growth of beard and wear-
ing my oldest clothes, it had been
raining steadily for two days. More
than 7 inches of rain had fallen in
less than a month, and the camp on
the once beautiful, tree-lined mall
next to the Reflecting Pool of the
Lincoln Memorial had become a
stinking quagmire of churned, red-
dish-brown mud. Resurrection City,
a revolutionary camp, wallowed in
the odor of an open sewer.

Through the filthy canvas parti-
tion. which formed the door of the
tent-shaped hut to which I was as-
signed, I watched the torrents of rain
for hours, hoping for a break in the
weather. A chill wind whipped
through the cracks of my shanty,
one of hundreds designed by pro-

June 26, 1968

fessional architects working for the
revolutionaries running this show—
architect-designed misery, as it were.
Although they were fairly warm, the
blankets which had been given me
upon arrival (to get them I falsely
identified myself as a member of the
Communist W.E.B. DuBois Clubs
and was greeted as a Comrade) were
crawling with lice and they were
damp from the constant drizzle.
In marked contrast to the mag-
nificent Lincoln Memorial which
loomed in the distance, the campsite
was an utter shambles. Throughout
the large, fenced-in area of the camp,
which had been declared off-limits
to the police by federal officers, there
were heaps of soaked and discarded
clothing, children’s shoes, under-
clothing, trousers, stockings, dresses.
Mounds of rotting garbage lay every-
where, covered with flies and mag-
gots. Added to the misery was the
stench of human waste which saturat-
ed the air whenever a sudden breeze
blew through the doorless latrines
dotting the encampment. These
structures were known as “Johnny
on the Spot” by those poor souls who
had been conned into this night-
mare scene by the revolutionaries be-
hind the Campaign. Entering one of
them at night was a nauseating and
unforgettable experience. The condi-
tions in this “ghetto” created on the
banks of the Potomac by the South-
ern Christian Leadership Conference
were a classic case of instant slum.
Those of us living in Resurrection
City endured a monstrous phantas-

23

magoria of degradation and moral
decay. While there I witnessed the
desecration of historical monuments,
the ripping and defiling of Ameri-
can flags, indescribable filth, and a
pervading and wanton disregard for
law and order as paramilitary revo-
lutionaries from groups calling them-
selves the Raiders, the Rat Pack,
Commandoes, and Blackstone Ran-
gers threatened whites and called
for “killing whitey” and “burning
down America.” What I saw, in fact,
was a microcosm of one of the major
projects of the Communist Party,
U.S.A—another manifestation of a
revolutionary program aimed at the
destruction of the United States of
America. How do I know it was
part of a Communist program? Be-
cause I was there. Because I saw the
the Comrades in action.

I watched as a relatively small
group of revolutionaries, led by a
hard core of Communists and fellow-
travelers, demanded billions of dol-
lars in blackmail from the U.S. Con-
gress and were backed by powerful
“Liberals” in government; as they
were promoted by powerful “Liber-
als” in the news media; as they were
protected in their violent actions by
a Leftist Attorney General. I even
left with proof that the “demands”
of the Poor People’s Campaign were
written by the Communist-controlled
Women’s International League for
Peace and Freedom.

Those running this show know
very well what they are doing.

Among those I found working

24

hardest at Resurrection City was _
an important revolutionary named
Mvles Horton, President of a Com-
munist’ training school called the
Highlander Research and Education
Center. Horton and I talked for
many hours about the Comrades’
revolutionary project for the “poor,”
and he even offered me a job help-
ing out in the Highlander Center
operated on the campsite. Myles,
trained in the Young Communist
League in his youth, has devoted
a lifetime to the Communist cause.
Another Highlander official, Walter
Bishop, informed me that the High-
lander goal was to “educate the Ap-
palachian poor to overthrovy the sys-
tem.” He explained to me that the
final plans for the Poor People’s
Campaign were made at a two-day
meeting of the Communist South-
ern Conference Educational Fund in
Atlanta on April 25-26. Those in at-
tendance included such Communists
as Carl and Anne Braden and Jack
McMichael.

Among those with whom your re-
porter tramped through the garbage
was the “Reverend” Ralph D. Ab-
ernathy, successor to Dr. Martin
Luther King, and new President of
the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference. Ralph is as famous for
his perverted sexual escapades as
for his affiliation with Communist
causes, having once been chased
down a metropolitan avenue with a
hatchet for perverted sexual activity
with a fifteen-year-old girl. He has
also cavorted as a Co-Chairman of

The Review of the NEWS

_the National Mobilization Commit-
tee, which has been cited by the
House Committee on Un-American
Activities as being controlled by the
Communist Party; he was also the
first signer of a petition for executive
clemency for Communist Carl Bra-
den after Braden had been convicted
of sedition; and, he has been closely
linked with the activities of the
Southern Conference Educational
Fund and the National Committee
to Abolish HUAC, two cited Com-
munist fronts. Abernathy, the Di-
rector of the Poor People’s Cam-
paign, has stated that “cities will
burn” if his demands are not met.
The “Reverend” James Bevel, an-
other official of the Communist-con-
trolled Southern Christian Leader-
ship Conference with whom I
marched and attended revolutionary
training sessions at Resurrection City,
was National Director of the Com-
munist National Mobilization Com-
mittee during the Reds’ Vietnam
Weck project in 1967. Commenting
on the burning of an American flag,
Bevel has declared: “I feel no re-
sponsibility to a nation-state... .
I don’t get too excited when I see
a rag on a stick called a flag.” He
cited the purpose of the Poor Peo-
ple’s Campaign as being: “To re-
distribute the wealth of the U.S. and
turn the means of production over
to the people . . . . To eliminate all
armaments .... All local and state
police must be ‘re-oriented.’ . . . To
rid the world of all the ‘fascists and
jitter-bug fascists.’”” Reverend Bevel

June 26, 1968

worked with militant Negro gangs
in Chicago, where he has an ex-
tensive arrest record, and where he
trained the O.E.O.-funded Black-
stone Rangers in guerrilla tactics.

Another top Revolutionary on the
scene was Marxist Barbara Deming,
Editor of the Communist-oriented
Liberation magazine, who has de-
clared: “Talking to Ho chi Minh is
like talking to the man next door
....he is a man of humor, shrewd-
ness, and a lot of humanity.” Barbara
Deming and I marched together
with the “poor” on assaults on the
Department of Agriculture and the
State Department. Others with
whom I “demonstrated” were Reies
Lopez Tijerina, the Castroite leader
of the Federation of Free City States,
a Marxist outfit formerly called the
Federal Alliance of Land Grants;
Rudolfo “Corky” Gonzales, who says
he favors armed revolution and is
head of the Crusade For Justice,
funded by the War on Poverty;
Richard Romero, another Tijerina
lieutenant who made his _head-
quarters in Washington at the Com-
munists’ Hawthorne School; and.
Bayard Rustin, a convicted sex-per-
vert, former member of the Young
Communist League, and for 12 years
an organizer for the Communist
Party. Rustin resigned his post as
organizer for the Campaign's Soli-
darity Day March due to a disagree-
ment with that other moralist, the
“Reverend” Ralph Abernathy. It
seems Rustin didn’t want enough
“violent nonviolente.”

25

Pillars of the encampment whom
I have positively identified included:
Communist Carl Bloice of the Na-
tional Committee of the Communist
Party, U.S.A.. and a Communist
DuBois Club leader; S.C.L.C. Ad-
visor Robert Collier — a disciple of
Communist Che Guevara—who was
convicted of a plot to blow up the
Statue of Liberty, the Washington
Monument, and the Liberty Bell;
Lee Webb, a former National Secre-
tary of the Marxist Students for a
Democratic Society, and an organ-
izer for the Marxist Institute of
Policy Studies; William F. Pepper,
Executive Secretary of the Commu-
nist-dominated National Conference
for New Politics, and advisor to
S.C.L.C. official Hosea Williams.
Williams, the “direct-action leader”
of the Campaign, was involved in a
nasty mess in October 1965 when a
stolen car ring was found to be sup-
plying automobiles to Williams and
the S.C.L.C.

Other leaders of the Campaign in-
cluded Ralph Wheeler, former editor
of the Hinds County Newsletter ot
the subversive Mississippi Freedom
Democratic Party; Carl and Anne
Braden, Communist organizers in
the South and ofhcials of the Com-
munist Southern Conference Educa-
tional Fund, who raised money for
the Campaign and drew up final
plans for the encampment; Nora
“Muffy” North, daughter of Com-
munist Joseph North, and corre-
spondent for the Communist Work-
er; Cleveland Robinson, President of

the Negro American Labor Council, |
cited in the Communists’ Political
A ffairs as “one of the most important
organizations in the country”; and,
the entire national staff of the Com-
munist W.E.B. DuBois Clubs, head-
ed by Communist Jarvis Tyner, the
DuBois Clubs’ National Chairman.

Yes, the Poor People’s Campaign
is very important indeed to the
Communists. According to a cable
sent to the leaders of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference by
Vietcong leader Ho Thu, the Poor
People’s Campaign is “an offensive
against the ruling circles” in America
and will put “more weight behind
the demand for an end to the War
in Vietnam.” Communists around
the world have saluted the work of
the Comrades in Washington.

In short, the Poor People’s Cam-
paign has been a project which has
been led, manipulated, and operated
by the Communists. It has been a
major propaganda show for the
Reds, subjecting its dupes to misery
and filth worse than anything to be
found in the ugliest slum in Harlem.
I watched and worked with the
Communists running the show there.
I spent a full day operating the
switchboard at Resurrection City,
noting the names of the Comrades
calling in advice, messages, and di-
rectives. I ate, slept, and waded in
their stench. If the Communists suc-
ceed at what they are trying to do,
dear reader, I have seen the future

. . and it is a garbage heap.
