Honorable Dan K. Moore
Governor of North Carolina
Raleigh, North Carolina 27602

Dear Governor Moore:

As an American citizen who has deep love and respect for our great
nation and the principles on which it was founded, I feel I must exercise
my freedom of speech to cry out against certain injustices and certain
acts that deprive law abiding citizens of their rights.

During the past three days, I saw and felt what life is like ina
totalitarian state. I live in Wilmington, N. C. and at 3 p.m. Sunday
afternoon, April 7, a curfew was placed on this city and we were forced
to remain in our homes while a few demonstrators in certain areas of our
city proceeded to harass law enforcement officers with bricks and stones.
The local newspaper Stated that 70% of the troublemakers were between the
ages of 9 and 13 years old. As a result of this small minority, the
majority of citizens could not attend church or school or any function for
three days. This small minority was confined to a certain section of this
city. Why couldn't our law enforcement officers have blocked off these
sections of our city, thus confining the troublemakers instead of punish-
ing 93% of the population because of the misbehavior of 7%. Tactics such
as these demonstrated by the local officials in confining private citizens
are the same actions applied in Communist countries to surpress and reStrict
individuals. Our enemies are now aware of the ways and means at their
disposal to control the movement and rights of private citizens, to control
schools and regulate our very activities.

I am aware of all the arguments made by local government and police
officials for enforcing a curfew, but none of these are valid when there
were other methods at their disposal for dealing with this problem. We can
not allow a small minority to dictate to the majority of law abiding
citizens and take our freedoms as they strive to destroy our very way of
life.

As our elected leader, it is your duty and reSponsibility to protect
the rights and preserve the liberty of every citizen. 1 appeal to you to use
whatever power available to you to see that justice is dispensed in our state -
that law breakers are punished - that decent, law abiding citizens are
protected, but not subjected to curfews and restrictions such as those
witnessed by us these last few days.

Dear Mrs. Knight:

The Governor is out of the city at the present time and I am
responding to your letter to him of recent

Yor your information, I am enclafing a copy of his television
statement which he made as the riots sybsided. You understand that
he does not have the power or the authérity to establish curfews and
that he did mot do so in the City of Wilmington. Nonetheless, I am
aware of the fact that it is his opinion the establishment of these curfews
throughout the State of North Carolina prevented an ever great distruction
of property, perhaps even a loss of life. It is indeed regretable that a
small minority of our citisens have brought so much distruction and
misery upea the majority of the population. I am also sure that you
are aware of the fact that the Governor did everything in his power to
bring the matter to a swift and a sure end. Another matter concerning
breaches of the law is up to the courts, and we must await the outcome
of those trials.

I will bring your letter to the Governor's personal attention when
he returas.

With best wishes, I am

Sineerely,

George R. Ragedale
Legal Counsel to the Governor
