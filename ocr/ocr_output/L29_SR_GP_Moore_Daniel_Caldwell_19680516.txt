OFFICE OF THE CHANCFLLOR

Box 5067 Ziv 27607 16 May 1968

The Honorable Dan K. Moore
Governor of North Carolina
Raleigh, North Carolina

My dear Governor Moore:

At the time Assistant Professor Hausman made the regret-
table assertions on Sunday, April 7, the remarks did not immediately
register with me for I was concentrating on getting the marchers to
disperse. Nor did I hear any of the subsequent broadcasts. It was,
therefore, not until a few days later that it was brought to my attention
precisely what had been said.

I perhaps should have written you immediately my deep
apologies for this grievous incident which occurred on the sidewalk
of our campus and was spoken by a member of this faculty. Instead
I have concentrated on the possibility of achieving from him and
our faculty a suitable expression of apology and concern. I have not
given up on this latter course, but I have not yet succeeded.

I can only beg you, as much as is humanly possible, to
minimize the incident, to accept my word that large numbers of this
faculty were dismayed at the remark,and leave it to me to give you

a later report.

Meantime, be assured that there has not been the slightest
lack of concern on my part and that my distress at the calumny
is real and great.

Respectfully yours,

nT. Caldwell
