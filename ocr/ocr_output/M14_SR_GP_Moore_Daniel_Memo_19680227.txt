RE: INCIDENT INVOLVING POSSIBLE RACIAL OVERTONES

On Thursday, 22 February 1968, during a court trial in
Elizabeth City Recorder's Court, a subject known as "Beefy"
Layden, who operates "Beefy's" Drive-In, 909 W. Ehringhaus
Street, Elizabeth City, was appearing as a witness and dur-
ing the cross examination, it was revealed that he did not
and would not serve negroes at his eating establishment.
Upon further questioning as to why he would not, he stated
that they (the negroes) acted like a herd of cattle. This
statement caused some stir of obvious resentment in the
courtroom, and unconfirmed information since then reveals
that further resentment is possibly building primarily at
the negro college there.

There hasn't been any trouble as yet; however, under the
circumstances, this office is reporting the incident in com-
pliance with recent instructions regarding the involvement
of the Good Neighbor Council.
