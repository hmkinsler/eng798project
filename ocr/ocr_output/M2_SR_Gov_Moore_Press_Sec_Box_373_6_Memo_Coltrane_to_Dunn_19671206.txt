MEMORANDUM
TO: D. S. Coltrane
FROM: Preston C. Hill

SUBJECT: Winston-Salem Post Riot Report

The City Manager of Winston-Salem, Mr. John M. Gold, informed
representative that it has been recognized and accepted as a fact
that the policemen's attitudes to treatment of people over the years
had much to dc with community attitudes and reactions: City officials
are working with the police department. At a meeting. Gold suggested
that the city would help any officer find anovcner job if that officer
felt he could not adjust. The words were much stronger. Verified by
a police officer. The Negro community is not over-policed any more.
They ao not feel that the police are breathing down their necks.

They are watching the city government's action and attitudes. Expect
continuous progress.

EMPLOYMENT

Reynolds, Hanes Corp., Western Electric and Wachovia Bank were -
named as businesses with very poor over-all employment practices.
There igs much under-employment of Negroes in these businesses. They
want more Negroes at or near the top.

City and county employment is not representative of the Negro
population. It feels that there should be some Negro foremen of
peneral work crews in the city. The city has taken employment of
Negroes. |

HOUSING

The airport is near the best Negro sections and expanding big
jets are being brought in. There is.a need for open housing. The
Negroes do rot want to build in the Strport area because of the
noise and danger. More choices of living area around and throughout /

the city are needed. Public housing and housing for the aged is
needed. A proposal was sent to Atlanta 18 months ago and is in
Washington, D. C. now. The old people still live in old houses.

STATE NAACP MEETING AT DURHAM
November 24 & 25,. 1967

The annual state NAACP meeting began with memorial services
followed by appointments of committees and the President's address.
Pressure was great at this meeting because President Alexander and
Field Secretary Charles McLean were being challenged for their ey

ositions. Much of the timers spent revi the euccesses of the a a
fAACP and reminding the people that NAACP was. ighting for Civil manta.

mostly middle aged and elderly people. Youth was scarce. {

working

weedy discussed in
corridors by youth and young adults that NAACP needs new life and new
ideas if it is to survive. A strong conservation organization of this
type is very necessary to cut into the extremeness of the Black Power
advocates. It is possible that such an organization can get Black
Power advocates to stop and listen. They ask a very good question of
Black Power or activists. After all the "Hell" and burning, then what
do they have to offer the people, the city, stateor nation’

HOUSING WORKSHOP

Rev. Kelly 0. P. Goodwin feels that the people of a community need
to get together more often, come to the housing or other board meetings
and help the usual one representative. The individuals with the
problems usually can get the problem over better than anyone else.

People have to learn to make use of the opportunity to confront the
government with problems that affect them. Mr. A. L. Thompson is the
representative of H. U. D. The major thrust of H. U. D. (Federal
Government) sight selection policy is to break down discrimination in
public housing wherever it exists. New goals of H. U. D. are: 1.
Conserve and expand housing for low and moderate income families.

2. Develop new employment opportunities for unemployed and underemployed.
3. Emphasize urban renewal programs for those with the most criticalneeds.
Housing programs to be looked into are 203-FHA, 221-House 40 Yr. Loan-FHA,
and 220 H Rehabilitation.

H. U. D. proposes to increase support for houses for larger families.
The average Negro family has 4.5 children. They need diversified
individual or group public housing and the poor integrated into society.
Learning takes place two ways when the poor and successful people live
together.

Ben Ruffin - Durham UOCI - Housing affects the economic - Houses
go up for Negroes if purchased in or near white communities. Renters
exploit the poor.

Bducation - Negroes live in one section and attend inferior schools.
Whites are moving out of the city leaving old schools for Negroes.
They sre building new schools outside the city for whites. There is a
$10,000,000 bond issue in Durham county, $7,000,000 for the county and
$3 000 000 in the city. The whites are moving to the county.

Political - There are 30+ precincts in Durham and Raleigh. The
Negroes all live in 3 or 4+ precincts. The whites don't like the power
of black vote. It is used all the time by the whites but bad now that
the Negro learned to use it.

Laws need to be passed to protect the tenent's interests. If they
pay by the month, the tenent has to move on a 7-day notice of the .and-
lord. If they pay rent by the week, the tenent has to move after a 3-
day notice.

Fair representation is needed for fair consideration from the
eovernment. ‘The Durham Housing Authority has one Negro on the board
out of 5 members, but public housing is 75% black. Black has little
or no voting chance on a board outnumbered 4+ to 1.

YOUTH MEETING
ROLE OF YOUTH IN COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION

Fuller - Community organization only counts when one can exhibit
the ability to get people on the streets when needed. Talks are no
good. Negro identity is needed. The people move when there is some
force disturbing them. Education is harmfui to the Negro as it is at
this time.

Ruby Hurley, NAACP Southeast Regional Director, debated Fuller's
Black Power activism instead of giving sa presentation. It was quite
evident that the youth were with Fuller. Fuller was attacked and the
question and snswer perod was controlled by the people in charge and
time. There was an indication that a split may result between Black
Power advocates and the NAACP as a result of something tnat happened
at this conference. As off base as Black Power advocates may be, in
terms of the norms of society, they have to be dealt with. They ere
daring and rebellious, but they can hurt the main stream and majorities
of this American society. The middle class conservatives, white and
black, cannot do anything other than meet these people with force and
human destruction unless the parent (gov 4+) is willing to understani
and try to correct the child. These people do not respect orderly
process because it is too slow. They sare motivated by 300 years of
hate and hostility. They feel and believe that freedom must come now.
They refuse to accept the fact that whites have to learn and readjust.
This is Looked upon as a white problem by Black Power advocates.

NAACP may have missed an opportunity to help the country when they
rejected and tried to humiliate and suppress the freedom of speech of
the Black Power advocates at their meeting.

Black Power, as seen with its anger and rebellion at this meeting,
is a terriole threat to all Americans. These people must be reached
or North Cerolina must be prepared to gun down or capture and imprison
a segment of its citizens.
OBSERVATIONS

Times appear crucisl for the NAACP. It appears that its very
existence is threatened. Open housing is the target for 196*.

Qli or existing leadership has to realize that what was a-:-:
yesterday or last year is now ancient history to vouth. The yc .>
live for now :nd want their freedom now. The youth is hard to
communicate with vecause they are so wrapped up in the new movemen’
Chat they will not listen to anything that is not immediete 3nd action
oriented. Old or existing leadershin will have to become involved with
youth and give guidance where it can be given until such time as youth
Will 2sgein respect older ieadership and accept some of the same.

Local State and Federal Government could help tne over-2ll situation
by encouraging old and existing leaderships to merge with youth end try
to understand and feel the realism of the youth m:vement. The ¢' tuation
cannct be helped by rejecticns, suppression, separation or ign ring the
Facts.
