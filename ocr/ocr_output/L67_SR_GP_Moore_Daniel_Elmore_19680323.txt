against the Democratic Republic of
{North} Vietnam so that talks may
start.” Last Sunday I expressed the
position of the United States with
respect. to. peace in) Vietnam and
Southeast Asia. In that statement |
said: ‘Now, as in the past, the United
States is ready to send its representa-
tives to any forum, at any time. to
discuss the means of bringing this
war toanend. Accordingly, we will
establish contact with the representa-
tives of North Vietnam. Consulta-
tions with the Government of South
Vietnam and other allies are now
taking place.” (The remainder of
the North Vietnamese statement con-
sisted of a vicious diatribe against the
United States. The Reds used such
terms as “U.S. imperialists.” “war of
destruction,” “extremely barbarous
crime of aggression,” “wicked and
perfidious schemes and tricks of the
U.S. imperialists and their lackevs,”
and “U.S. neo-colonialism.” They
described President Johnson's partial
bombing pause as “a deteat, and at
the same time, a perfidious trick of
the U.S. Government to appease
public opinion.” And they asserted
that “nothing can save the U.S. ag-
gressors from a total defeat.”)

Tax Surcharge Passed in Senate

@ Washington, April 2—The Senate
passes (53 to 35) the 10 per cent in-
come tax surcharge that President
Johnson has been trying to get since
last August. The surcharge, which
is tied to a $6 billion cut in federal
spending, is part of a broad tax-

April 10, 1968

spending package that also includes
extending excise taxes on new cars
and telephone bills and speeding up
corporate tax collections. This mea-
sure still must be approved by the
House of Representatives.

The Wisconsin Primary

B Milwaukee, April 2 — Senator
Eugene McCarthy's peace campaign
prevails over the ghost candidacy of

McCarthy comes out on top in Wisconsin.
President Johnson in) Wisconsin's
presidential primary. With nearly all
of the votes counted, McCarthy has
406,098 votes or 57 per cent of the
Democratic total; Johnson has 249.
518, equivalent to 35 per cent; and
Senator Robert Kennedy has about 6
per cent. On the Republican side,
Richard Nixon has 385,052 votes or
80 per cent of the total, while Gov-
ernor Ronald Reagan of California
has 51.574, about 11 per cent.

Supreme Court on Apportionment
@ Washington, April 1 — The Su-
preme Court extends (5 to 3) its so-
called one-man, one-vote doctrine to
the level of elected county and city
governments. The decision, which
could affect more than 80,000 coun-

7

ty, municipal, and township units in
the same way that the court's 1964
apportionment ruling affected state
legislatures, holds that if a govern-
ing body is elected on a district o
precinct basis for a geographical area
the voting districts must be substan-
tially equal in population. Justice By-
ron R. White, for the majority, says
that he sees “little difference in terms
of the application of the equal pro-
tection clause [in the Constitution |
and of the principles of [the 1964
decision] between the exercise of
state power through legislatures and
its exercise by elected officials in the
cities, towns, and counties.” Justice
John M. Harlan, who opposed the
1964 ruling, sharply dissents, com-
menting: “I continue to think that
these adventures of the court in the
realm of political science are beyond
its constitutional powers.”

A Separate Negro Nation

® Detroit, March 30—Delegates to 4

black nationalist convention draft a
declaration of independence from
the United States, which, among
other things, calls for “blacks who
go into the street, fight for freedom,
and fall into American hands” to be
treated as prisoners of war. At the
meeting, which was sponsored by
the Malcolm X Society, the delegates
also draft a constitution for a sepa-
rate Negro nation to be set up in
Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina,
Mississippi, and Louisiana. Accord-
ing to Milton Henry, one of the or-
ganizers of the convention, “ee

could achieve “delegate” status only

by indicating that they intended to |
renounce their American citizenship \
and become citizens of the new na-
tion. It is to be called “The Songhay
Republic” after what was described
as a medieval African empire. Henry

man and a graduate of Yale Univer
sity Law School.

situation is finally brought under
control at midnight. The violence
began as young Negroes started
breaking windows, looting — stores.
and fighting with police along the
route of a protest march led by agi-
tator Martin Luther King. King
organized the demonstration to force
the city to negotiate with striking
garbage collectors, most of whom

are Negroes. The collectors have
been on strike since early February
in a demand for higher pay and
union representation. As soon as the
trouble started, King sprinted down
a side street, leaped into a car, and
sped away.

® Washington, March 29—President
Johnson offers federal help to states
and cities that need it to control
Negro rioting. Addressing the AFL-
CIO's Committee on Political Edu-
cation, Johnson declares: “IT want to
again assure you that the resources
of your government stand behind
local law enforcement agencies to the
full extent of our constitutional au-
thority. Mindless violence — destrov-
ing what we have worked so hard to
build — will never be tolerated in
America.” In a statement released
by the White House a few hours
later, the President refers specifically
to. yesterday's rioting in Memphis.
“The tragic events in Memphis ves-
terday remind us of the grave peril
rioting poses,” says Johnson. “This
nation must seek change within the
rule of law in an environment of
social order. Rioting, violence, and
repression can only divide our people.
Evervone loses when a riot occurs.”
@ Memphis, March 29 — Martin
Luther King blames yesterday's
noting on a “small group of young
militants” and vows to stage another
massive demonstration in this. city
next week. “It would be a tragic
error to give up now and leave the
impression that we are retreating
because of what happened yesterday,”

April 10, 1968

the agitator says at a press con-
ference. “Riots are here. Riots are
part of the ugly atmosphere of our
society now.” King adds that he
cannot guarantee that there will be
no riots in Memphis next week, or in
Washington next month when he
leads his “poor people’s march” in
the nation’s capital. “I can only
guarantee our own demonstration
will be non-violent,” he comments.

@ Washington, March 29—Senator
Robert C. Byrd (D.-W. Va.) urges
the Johnson Administration to pre-
vent Martin Luther King from car-
rving out his “poor people's march”
here next month. Noting the damage
caused in Memphis by King’s agita-

Byrd labels
King a “self-seeking
rabblerouser.”

tion, Byrd asserts that “if this self-
seeking rabblerouser is allowed to go
through with his plans here, Wash-
ington may well be treated to the
same kind of violence, destruction,
looting, and bloodshed.” King “lays
down the fuses,” Byrd continues.
then stirs his followers to flames with
a “storehouse of volatile phrases such
as ‘bloodless war, ‘direct action
program, ‘crisis-packed — situation,
‘dramatic confrontation,’ ‘attention-
getting activities, ‘pressure, and
‘civil disobedience. Martin Luther
King had no business in Memphis.
He should never have gone there for

tion. There is no doubt that he must
be held directly responsible for much
of what took place in Tennessee, and
he will have to bear the onus for
Whatever takes place in Washington
if he carries through with his threat-
ened demonstration here.”

B Washington, March 31 — Martin
Luther King says that he would call
off his scheduled demonstration here
only if he received from the Admin-
istration “a commitment with a time-
table attached to it” that would aid
King’s “poor people.” He adds, how-
ever, that he does not see such a
commitment forthcoming. At a press
conference, the agitator warns that
unless Congress does more about pov-
erty “it is going to Tead to a right-
wing takeover that will spell fascism.
I hate to predict violence. IT hate
violence so much, but I have to ad-
mit that the conditions that brought
violence last summer are still noto-
nously with us.” King also announces
that because of the situation in Mem-
phis he will not be able to fly to
Africa to trv to end the civil war in
Nigeria. He promises to send an aide
in his place.

@ Memphis, April 1—The Reverend
James Bevel meets with local leaders
and announces that “we are going to
escalate our pressure on this city.”
Bevel. a top aide to Martin Luther
King, then rants that “the leadership
of Memphis is mentally deranged.

King announces that he will ignore
the order. Claiming that the injunc-
tion is a “basic denial of First
Amendment privileges,” the agitator
proclaims that “we are not going to

disabling gas| or injunctions or any
other method that the city plans to
use.

No U.S. Gold to Debtor Nations

@ Wushington, March 28—The Sen.
ate votes (48 to 25) to suspend sales
of gold to any nation that is more
than 90 davs in arrears on anv debt
to the United States. This amend-
ment to the tax bill currently before
the Senate was sponsored by Peter
Dominick (R. Colo.) and would af-
tect a long list of nations, including
France, Britain, and India. During
the same debate, the Senate defeats
(44 to 38) an amendment by Karl
Mundt (R.-S.D.) that would have
imposed an additional 20 per cent
tax on all the income of anv com-
