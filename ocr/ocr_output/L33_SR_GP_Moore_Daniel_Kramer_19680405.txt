Governors Mansion
Raleigh, North Carolina.

Dear Govermor Moore:

Now that we've seen that Raleigh im particular and North
Carolima as a whole, are not immune to racial outbreaks what
will be done about it? The continual calling up of the National
Guard and riot poliee? This creates nothing more than bitter
resentment against white authority and it leavess a pervading
atmosphere of tension and strife all around. As I rode through
Raleigh today, I could sense this embitterment and hostility and
it's a frightening feeling.

By mo means do I condone rioting and violence, but I do not
condone social injustice. Martin Luther King's or anyone else's
death is mo excuse for violence. But should social injustiee be
met with apathy orn the part of those who it is direeted against?

As Governor you must realize that 25% of your eonstitueney
is blaek. Yet, discrimination in schools, housing, interest
rates, employment and "publie” enterprise still exists. North
Carolina isn't any better or any worse than the other Southern
States in these discriminatory attitudes and their perpetuation
(although we are behind other areas of the country in this res-
pect). Do we get meh comfort in this fget? I don'tJ

Why do the North Carolina legislators persist in overlooking
the faet that problems exist? Poverty is quite a widespread
disease in this state, but ome would never know this by listening
to the officials who represent us. I'd say that it is a fair
estimation to say that the m jority of whites im Raleigh have
never seen the deplorable conditions which exist in South Raleigh.
The fact tnat urban renewal will oecur doesn't amend the facet
that 900 families will be displaced and the proposal for the urban
renewal project provides housing for only 50 families. Is there
justice in displacing people while not providing a place for them
to go.

This state is so wrapped up in its highway program that it has
ignored its humam program. But I feel that this is not just an
oversight, it is 80% intentional.

When is something going to be done? When it's too late?J
When mass civil disorder occurs? How many more years will the black
mam have to wait for justice? I don't think we have too many years
left. In fact, I would even call that an exaggeration. Months
maybe: more applicable.

It is obvious that something should be done now , not ome or
two months from mow.

As the political head of this state, you should be able and

willi to initiate appropriate legi ti t
injustices. I know t is is an easy thine s, Cate eee anes

Gov. Dan K. Moore -2= April 5, 1968

propose, but it had better become an easy thing to do.

The racial crisis is not a Black problem, it's a white problem.
With Martin Luther King as the nonviolent buffer between blaeks and
whites, there was a chamee for peaceful restructuring of our social
system. This buffer is gome and the chance of peace is almost non-
existent. This is a white problem because white people control
this country and have the power to bring about change. This is a
white problem beeause the Commission on Civil Disorders is correct
in its evaluation of the cause of disorder --

WHITE RACISM.

Is there any doubt In your mind that severe injustices have
and are occuring? Is there any doubt that equality stands for all
men -- not just white men -- mem regardless of color??

Cam you as a State Representative sit back and do nothing??

I hope notj I pray not)

Soeial justice is necessary for this mation to survive. Help
it survived)

Sincerely,

Kemneth Kramer
(Amn ashamed and troubled
white man. )
