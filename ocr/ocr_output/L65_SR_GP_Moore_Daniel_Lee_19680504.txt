The Honorable Governor Dan K. Moore
Governor of North Carolina
Governor's Office

Raleigh, North Carolina

Dear Governor Moore:

We are most thankful to you for your telegram, April 6, 1968,
in which you appealed for Order in the State. We wholly agree that
Order must be established in the State, and we pledge our support
to its establishment. We further pledge to give ourselves
unreservedly to the encouragement of the maintenance of Order.

It is well to note that we have used the word ORDER, rather than
the phrase “law and order." We have done this for two specific
reasons. (1) The phrase "law and order" is a misnomer in its most
honest admission (2) We hold law as a part of Order. It is the latter
statement that we shall deal with briefly and appeal to you for your
help as Governor of North Carolina and Governor of all the people,
black and white.

Law is a part of Order; it is not a part equal with Order such
as the phrase "law and order." The administration of law is the basic
cause for dis-Order, whether this administration is in the enactaent
of laws, or the injustice in their application. Im order that we are
understood, let us give an example: We have laws in North Carolina
for which the penalty is death for their violation - - the black man
has paid this penalty many times for acts conmitted against white
people in North Carolina, but never has a white man paid the death
penalty for the very same acts committed against Negroes even though
they have been numerous. The failure here was to apply the law justly.
It is this injustice and cruelty which has disturbed order and
created disorder.

It is not a lack of respect for law. Most men have high respect
for law, but we must be honest with you, they have lost confidence in
white man to administer it fairly and rightly. Confidence must be
rebuilt, faith must be established, and justice must become a reality

2 - Governor Dan K. Moore, May k, 1968

blind to the color of one's skin. It is here we appeal to you to help
us establish Order. We will continue to work for the good of mankind,
uninhibitedly by the color of one’s skin. We appeal to you as
Governor and other officials to help us to make this State, ag State
of justice, not based on race, but on t. We must be equally as
candid with you in closing as we have been throughout the letter, if
we do not arrive at justice without the color of one's skin, children
unbora today will hate tomorrow.

Most honorably yours,

Wilson W. Lee
