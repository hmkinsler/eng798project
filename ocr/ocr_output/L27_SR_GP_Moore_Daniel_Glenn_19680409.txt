Dear Geverner Meere:

Many ef my fellew Nerth Carelinians and I are mere than a little
disturbed by the lack ef leadership in the geverner’s mansien during the
current racial crisis. But even this last statement is incorrect, because
this crisis is mere ef an ecenemic than a racial struggle. Negroes in the
state ef Nerth Carelina have suffered under the legacy ef three hundred
years ef slavery and ef anether ene hundred years ef second-class citizen-
ship. They occupy an inferior secial pesitien because of their inferior
ecenomic status. Fer example, let me bring your attentien te recent
publications ef the Nerth Carelina Fund, to the many unwed Negre mothers
visiting Chapel Hill's Memerial Hespital, andvthe exclusive use ef Negrees
in menial pesitiens ameng UNC empleyees. A drive threugh eastern Nerth
Carelina is alse revealing.

Rather than prematurely calling out the Natienal Guard and preclaiming
a statewide ban en liquer sales, yeu might in the future attempt to help

the Negre ecenomically and educationally in the myriad ways pessible at the
present time. Yeu must previde the leadership necessary te calm and educate
the white cemmunity. Yeu must demenstrate that you are not the teol ef

the "establishment," as many ef your critics have charged. North Carelina
presently enjeys a unique eppertunity te previde fer the nation an example
ef state actien te ameliorate the cendition ef an unjustly eppressed mineri-
ty. Recent events indicate that the alternative is vielence entailing the
destruction of lives and property, pessibly of society itself. Please de
net fail us whe take pride in living in Nerth Carelina.

Sincerely yeurs,

Voss Ky Theva

Dear Mer. Glenn:

a

Thank you for your letter concernin ‘the recent
critical period through which North Caropilans have gone.

I appreciate having your co nts. However, it
was a necessary first step to provide State assistance to
the local authorities in suppress violence which had
broken out in a number of our unities.

You may be sure that we shall continue working
to resoive the problems w you mention. Through
established programs of e tion and training, manpower
development and procurement, low-income housing develop-
mem, public assistance,’ and other constructive projects
we are attempting to provide improved opportunities for
all eur less fortunate citizens, white and colored alike.

With best wishes, I am

Sincerely yours,
