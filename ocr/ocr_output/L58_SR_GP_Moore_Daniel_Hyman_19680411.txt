The Honorable Governor Dan Moore

Dear Governor Moores:

I am a traveling salesman from Richmond and I
spend quite a bit of time in Raleigh selling a line of
ladies ready to wear.

I was in Raleigh this week and frankly, I was a bit
puzzled as to why the American Flag flying from the State
Capiaal building was not flying at half mast to honor Dr.
King. While I realize that we all have our own feelings
about events and situations, it seems to me that things
of this sort do certainly provoke bitterness and hate
among people, regardless of who these people are. This,
to me, is a provocation on your part to stir up the people
at this time of extreme danger. I am just wondering why
a small thing like lowering a flag to half mast would be
so difficult for you to do. Certainly, as a Governor of
such a great state as North Carolinia, you would want to
see, especially at this time, harmony among the races.

Our great Governor, Mills BE. Godwin, ordered all
flags lowered here in Virginia to half mast w.th no
hesitation whatsoever.

It is no secret on my part that I am against the
mixing of the races, and I am solidly against the looting,
voilence, and burning that has taken place in the many
cities of the country, but I can not see for the like of
me why the Flag was flying at full mast. The state of
North Carolina as in Virginia has a large concentration
e colored people and in my mind to provoke any further

rouble at this time will certainly place all of us in

a pretty dangerous position. I would sug est that you
must realize that the time, place, and events today are
entirely different from some years ago. What I mean by
this is that you must be the Governor of all the people
or not be the Governor for any.

I would appreciate your comments on this.

Sincerely Yours,

Dear Mr. Hyman: |
Thank you for your letter in which you ask why the

American Flag on the State Capitol was not flown at half staff
in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King.’

On Sunday, April 7, the day of National mourning
proclaimed by the President, flags were not flown at State
office buildings, ae they were closed. Both the American and
North Carolina Flags, however, were flown at half staff at
the Executive Mansion on that day.

On Tuesday, April 9, the day of Dr. King's funeral,
the American and State Flags were flown at half staff at all
State buildings.

With best wishes, I am

Sincerely yours,

tu ak Dan Moore
