TO WIOME IT MAY CONCERN;

A request was sent out by the Governor to all ministers, and leaders,
asking them to use their influence in appealing to the people for peace
and order in this time .of confusion, over the death of Dr. Martin Luther

King, JDe

We will gladly do our best to keep peace and order, but quieting the
people down at this point will not solve the problem.

When a baby cries because he is hungry, jumping and rocking him does
not satisfy. It my quiet him for a few minutes, but does not take care
of the hungry appetite, so it is with the American Negro today. For 3500
years we have been crying for freedom, more out let and justice, We have
been given token, rocked with promises, and patted on the back, but no
longer has this remained sufficient for us, We must continue our fight
for what we call a full freedon.

President Abraham Lincoln heard our cries at the age of 12 and vowed
that he would try to bring an end to it. He 1it the torch and started the
trail for which we hizhly appreciate, but he was killed for his good deeds.

President John F,. Kennedy lit the second torch and stepped out to
make a home run for justice, according to the will of GOD, but was shot
down like a mad dog in the street.

Dr, Martin Luther King stepped out with President Kennedy for justice
for all people,

President Le B. Johnson has taken up the trail, that President Kennedy
left behind, He has stepped out like a man, and is holding tight to this
day, he has tried to give the baby the food it needs to grow a healthy
strong body.

Dr, Martin Luther King called for a non-violent program, and was in
the line with the President's march through the country asking for non-
violence, for justice for all vankind, justice that has been promised for
hundreds of years, but has not been implemented and for the very cause he
was shot down like a dog. The torch cannot trail in the dust, it must
shine until Freedom, Justice and Equality prevail for all mankind no
matter what nationality, what race, creed or color, because this is the will

of our Almighty GOD.
We must fight to establish the following things.

(1) To establish full fledge, Democracy, 4 Government with social equality
to all people without respect to race.

(2) To establish such Government, that there be laws requiring that each
Lerislative body and every Executive body bo intergrated of all races thet
are living under the laws that are made by the bodyse

(3) That complete equality employment to carried out in all business
ostablishments such as, (A) Fire Departments, (B) All Government Offices,
(C) All Mail Carriers both rural and city limits, (D) All Post Officc 3
mlerks, (E) All Highway Road Officers be intergrated, according to quali-
fications, (F) All Trucking Firms, (G( All Farm AAA Officers accordine to
qualifications, (H) All Stores Clerks according to qualifications, (I) To
conpletly abolish any type of discrimination, (J) And last but not least to
practice full fledce freedon to all people, regardless to race, creed or
colore
