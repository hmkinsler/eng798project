Honorable Dan Moore
Governor of North Carolina
State Capitol

Raleigh, North Carolina

Dear Governor Moores:

General Throckmorton, Commanding General, Third United States
Army, Atlanta, Georgia, who would, in all probability, be in command
of any Federal support that might be required in race disturbances,
requested that certain members of his staff be allowed to come to
North Carolina and visit the Negro areas of the cities he felt might

be trouble spots. I informed General Throckmorton that we would be
glad to have these people come provided we furnished the escort for
them and that both his and my officers would be in civilian clothes
and ride in a civilian automobile.

Four Colonels from Third Army were designated to make this in-
Spection, After briefing them in this Headquarters Wednesday,
February 14th, on our State plan, I had Colonel Hodgin accompany
them through the Cities of Raleigh, Durham, Greensboro, Winston-Salem
and New Bern. I feel that this will be very helpful in case of a
Federal requirement in this State,

Sincerely,

<a
