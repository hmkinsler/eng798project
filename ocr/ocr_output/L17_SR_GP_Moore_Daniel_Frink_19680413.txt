The Honarable Dan Ke Moorey Governor
of the Srate of North Carolina RES VIOLENCE, kekeke and Liquore
Raleigh, North Carolinae

Dear Sir: Greetings in the name of the Lord God Jesus Christ, God the Sone

April 7, 1968, I was in the services of Little Macedonia Missionary Baptist
Churchy Supplyy NeCe and heard the pastor, WeDe Frink say that he had received a
phone call from your office, asking him to instruct the people to please refrain
from violencee He complied with your request, but he did not need to have done ite

April 9, 1968 Iwas in a funeral servicey at Cedar Grove Missionary Baptist
Churchy Supplyy NeCe with WeHeDe Flowers, as officiating pastore He stated that
he had received a telegram from your office making the same requeste He also
complied with your request, but again there was no need for ite

May I say to you sir, that the Negro people of Brunswick County are not a
people given to violencey but they are a peace loving, law abiding, God honoring
peoplee We have not had even so much as one instance of violence committed by
any Negro person who is a citizen of Brunswick Countye They love the Gospele

The KeKeKe membership, that consists of white people, are the violent onese
They are constantly molesting the Negro people of Brunswick Countye Brother
Flowers said that he had received several threats recently, even to the extent
of one man with a shot gun hunder his arm threatened to kill him if he did not
cease to preach as he is preachinge He toldhim he would have to kill him to
stop him from preaching as he is preaching the Gospel of Salvation, Peace and
lovey nonsegregation and racial equality.

The KeKeKe it seems can do thisy since they have a charter granted to them
by the State Government, and the law is helpless or not concerned about curbing
the evils that they doe Their skin is white so that is alright, but just as soon
as a Negro undertakes to defend his rights, he is very much in the wronge

It also seems to me that you are not too much concermedy as to how many people
are killed on the highways by drunken drivers with automobiles, so long as they buy
their liquor from the legalized liquor storese It appears also that you are more
interested in liquor revenue than you are of the safety of human life on the streets
and highways of the State of North Carohinae

It is time that the KeKeKe and Alcoholic beverages be outlawede It is time and
past time, that the hooded knights of the KeKeKe be dealt with in a very positive
way for the violence that they commit. It is also time and past time that the
drunkards driving automobiles on NeCe highways be dealt with in a far more pcsitive

way than is being done at presente

THE NEW BIRTH -- WHAT IT IS, AND WHO NEEDS ITe
ALL SCRIPTURE QUOTATIONS ARE TAKEN FROM THE GEORGE Me LAMSA TRANSLATION

. John lle The Word was in the beginning, and that very Word was with God, and
God was that Worde 9- He was. the true light which lighted every man who come, into
the worlds 10- He was in the world and the world was under his hand, and yet the
world knew him note 1l- He came unto his own, and his own did not receive him, 12-
But thora who received him, to them he gave power to become sons of God, especially
to those who believe in his names 13- Those who are not of blood nor of the will of
the flest nor of the will of man, but born of Gode 14- And the Word became flesh
and dwelt among us, and we saw his glory, a glory like that of the firstborn of the
Father, full of grace and truthe 16- And of his fulness we have all received gracee

John 33i- There was at thet place a man of the Pharisees, named Wicodemuss a
leader of the Tews; 2- He came at night to Jesus and said to him, Rabbi, we know
that you are a ceacher sent from God} for no man can do these miracles that you are
doing unless Goce is with hime 3- Jesus answered, saying to him, Truly, Truly, I say
to youy if a man is not born again, he cannot see the kingdom of Gode 4- Nicodemus
said to him, How can an old man be'born again? Can he enter a second time into his
mother's womb and be born? 5- Jesus answered, saying to him, Truly, Truly, If a man
is not born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. 6-
What is born of flesh is flesh; and what is born of the Spirit is spirite 7= Do not
be surprised because I told you that you mst be born againe c- The wind blows where
it pleases, and you hear the sound$ but you do not know whence it comes and whither
it goes; such is every man who is born of the Spirit. **** 14- Just as Moses lifted
up the serpent in the wildermessy, so the Son of man is ready to be lifted ups 15- Sc
that every man who believes in him should not perish, but have eternal lifee 16- For
God so loved the world that he even gave his only begotten Son, so that whoever be-
lieves in him should not perish, but have eternal lifee 17- For God did not send his
Son into the world to condemn the world} but that the world should be saved by him.
18-He who believes in him will not be condemned; and he who does not believe has al-
ready been condemed for not believing in the name of the only begotten Son of Gode

It is evident from the two passages of Scripture quoted above, that Salvation
does not come to humanity by virtue of his own uprightnesse Salvation is vestec
oniy in the BLOOD that the Lord God Jesus Christ SHED on the CROSS for SIN and un-
cleannesse Without recognition of that BLOOD, regardless of how perfect in humar
virtue a person's life might be; when death comes he or she must meet God in Judg-
ment and ve unable to give an account of rejection of the SHED BLOOD on the CROSS tc
save him or her; for without the shedding of BLOOD there is no REMISSION of SIN.
Hebrews 9219-28. lt is not the BLOOD of animals, but the BLOOD of the Son of God.

First Samuel 1021-10 is the answer to why the Lord God Jesus Christ said unt<
Nicodemus, You are a teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things:
When a person receives the NEW BIRTH, God gives that person a NEW HEART and ture
him or her into another persone Regardless of what is written in the Scriptures the
reader thereof does not have possession of it until the experience of reception is
realized; but once realized, or received, then, and not until then, it is a reality;
in that person's life. Ist Corinthians 437 - For who has examined you? And what d«
you have which was not given to you? And if you did receive it, then why do you
boast as though you did not receive ite

Firat John 521+ Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God; anc
everyone who loves him who begot, loves him also who is begotten of hime 2- And by
this we know that we love the children of God, wher we love God and keep his com-
mandmentse 3- For this is the love of God, chat we keep his commandments; and hi:
commandments are not difficulte 4= For whoever is born of God triumphs over the
worlds; and this is the victory which conquers the world, even our faithe 5- Who je
he who triumphs over the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.

Notice that verse ] above reads 'Whoever'' and verse 4 reads 'Whatever''. Then
see John 3:6 above and notice its reading is 'What is borm of flesh is flesh; and
what is born of the Spirit is sapirit''. When God gives a NEW HEART to, and turns that
person int? anothers the ACTION is that the Spirit of God takes man's spirit, and by
virtue of BIRTH, translated man's spirit out of death into lifej out of SIN intc
RIGHTEOUSNESS, or out of the Devil into Christ and brings Christ into the heart of
the person as a SPIRITUAL BABY. This makes the HEART NEW. This is the other  persor:
into which the person is turnede It is the Lord God Jesus Christ, the Son of God who
comes in and brings His new nature and life into the heart of man. Thus by virtue of
the NEW BIRTH man becomes a NEW CREATURE; becomes reconciled unto God the Father anc
becomes a BABY member of the BODY of Christ - THE CHURCHe You must be born againe

James 1:17- Every good and perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the
Father of lights, with whom there is no variableness nor shadow of turninge 18- It
is he who beget us of his cw will with the word of truth, that we should be the
first fruits of his creaturese

PAGE 2, THE NEW BIRTH, WHAT IT 1S, AND WHO NEEDS IT.

First John 3:9- Whoever is born of God does not commit sin because
God's seed is in him and he cannot sin because he is borm of Gode

First Pater l3l?-And if you call on the Father, who is impartial and who judges
every nan according to his works, conduct yourselves reverently during the time of
your 8Qjourn here, 13- Knowing that you have not been redeemed from your empty works
which you have received from your fathers, by corruptible silver and gold, 19- But
with the precious blood of the Lamb without blemish and without spot which is
Christe 23- Being born again, not of corruptible seed, hut of incorruptible, by the
word of God, which lives and abides forevere See Matthew 24335 and Hebrews 128-12.

Romans \$1- Paul a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle and chosen
to proclaim tae gospel of God 2- Which was promised from early days by his prophets
in the holy sesiptures, 3- Concerning his son who was born in the flesh of the seed
of the house of David, 4- And who came to be known as the Son of God with power and
with the Holy Spirit, because he arose from the dead, and he is Jesus Christ our
Lorde 16- For 1 am nct ashamed of the gospel of Christ; for it is the power of God
to salvation to every one who believes, whether they are Jews first, or Arameanse

Romans 10°36- But the righteousness which is of faith, says thus: Do not say in
your heart, Who has ascended to heaven and brought Christ down to earth? 7- And whe
has descended into the abyss of Sheol and brought up Christ from the dead? 8- But
what does it say? The answer is near you, even in your mouth and in your heart, that
is, the word of faith which we preach; 9- Sc if you will confess with your mouth our
Lord Jesus and will believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you
shall be saved. 10- For the heart which believes dn him shall be declared righteous,
and the mouth which confesses him shall livee ll- For the scripture says, whosoever
believes in him shall not be ashamed. 12- And in this it does not discriminate be-
tween the Jews and the Arameans; for the same Lord over all ig rich to all who call
upon hime 13- For whoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.

Here in the above three paragraphs is stated the death and resurrection of the
Lord God Jesus Christ, God the Son, and the result of that death and resurrection to
those who REPENT of UNBELIEF and BELIEVE. Unbelief will only cast the one who has it
into TORMENT, so if you have not, why not repent and believe now and accept the Lord
God Jesus Christ as your SAVIOUR? If you have, then rejoice with me in that you
have, and pass this on to some one who has not believed and been saved as we have.

John 3224-Truly, Truly, 1 say to vou, He who hears my word and believes him who
sent me has everlasting life; and he does not come before the judgment; but passes
from death unto lifee 25- Truly, Truly, I sav to you, The time is coming, and it is
now already here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of Cod, and those who
hear it will live. 26- For as the Father has life in himself, ever 30 has he given
to the Son also to have life in himself. Please read on to verse 47 in the Bible.

Ephesians 221-22 states that the Gentiles, were dead in trespasses and sins,
and were without Christ, being aliens to the customs of Israel snd strangers to the
covenants of promise, without hope and without God in the world. Also that God is
rich in mercy to the Gentiles for His great love with which He loved us3; and that
the Lord God Jesus Christ, in His death in our stead broke down the wall of separa-
tions Also slew the ENMITY that was contained in the ordinances of the law, that he
might create out of the two, ONE NEW MAN, so making peacee This happens to those
who are dead in trespasses and ains, when they hear the voice of the Son of Gody the
Resurrection and the Life; by hearing that voice they are raised from death into NEW
LIFEe Man is saved by grace through faith, which is not of himself. God gives ite

Hebrews 9:1ll- But Christ, who had come, became the high priest of the good
things which he wrought; and he entered into a greater and more perfect tabernacle
which was not made by hand and was not of this world; 12- And he did not enter with
the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy
place, and obtained for us everlasting salvation. 13~ For if the blood of goats and
calves and the ashes of an heifer sprinkled on those who were defiled sanctified
them even to the cleansing of their flesh,14-How much more will the blood of Christ,
who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify your
conscience from dead works so that we may serve the living Gode Read on to verse 28.

First John 1:5- This then is tne good news which we have heard from him and
declare to you, that God is light and in him is no darkness at alle 6- If we say
that we have fellowship with him and yet live in darkness, we lie and do not follow
the truths; 7- But if we live in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship
with one another and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses from all sine 8= If we say
that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in use 9+ If we
confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us
from all our unrighteousness. 10- If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a
liar and his word is not in use See Hebrews 4312-14 for getting the WORD dato youe

PAGE 3, THE NEW BIRTH, WHAT IT IS, AND WHO NEEDS IT.

The SOUL is fed through the FIVE SENSES. Wnat is seen, heard, felt, tasted and
smelled igs that which the SOUL EATS. ‘There is no other way to FEED the SOUL.

It is evident from the Scriptures, that the NEW BIRTH is predicated upon the
sacrificial death of the Lord God Jesus Christe It takes an acknowledgment, first of
SIN, second of the SHED BLOOD of the Lord God Jesus Christ to cleanse from SIN; and
third, submission to and confession of the Lord God Jesus Christ as SAVIOUR, to re-
ceive the .!/SW BIRTH, and thus pass from DEATH into LIFE. The Lord God Jesus Christ
ig always FLITHFUL and JUST to FORGIVE sinners of their SIN of UNBELIEF, when such
turn from their SIN of UNBELIEF, in TRUE REPENTANCE, confess their SIN, and ask for
forgiveness because of His SHED BLOOD and then CONFESS Him to be their SAVIOUR, LORD
and MASTER. It is not enough to become convinced of SIN, of RIGHTEOUSNESS and of
JUDGMENT, as in John 1625-lle The sinner must acknowledge before God that he or she
is a sinner, but that is not enoughe Neither is it yet enough to believe in heart
that God the Father raised His Son from death to save you, as in Romans 1035-17+ The
sinner must be thoroughly convinced of the RESURRECTION of the Lord God Jesus Christ
to save him or her, but that is not enough. The sinner must confess the SIN of UN-
BELIEF. Sinners must accept the SHED BLOOD of the Son of God as a cleanser from the
SIN of UNBELIEF, which has been INHERITED instead of COMMITTED, and then also for
cleansing from all COMMITTED SINS, but that is not yet enoughe Having done this, the
sinner needs now only to CONFESS the Lord God Jesus Christ, God the Son, to be his
or her SAVIOUR. The first two confessions need be made only to God = not to MAN, but
the confession of God the Son as SAVIOUR must be made before MAN - THE CHURCH. When
the sinner has made this threefold confession and has truly repented of UNBELIEF and
really believes in HEART that the Son of God did die and has been raised from death
to save him or her, he or she has instantly passed from DEATH into LIFE, and is no
longer a sinner, but has become A CHRISTIAN, a baby in the BODY of Christ, which is
the CHURCHe The NEW BIRTH is a MUST to escape the fire of TORMENT. The above action
always brings deliverance from the SIN of UNBELIEF. Sinner, you must te born again!

Luke 24345- Then opened he their mind to understand the scripturese 46- And he
said to them, Thus it is written, and it was right, that Christ should sufter and
rise from the dead on the third day; 47- And that repentance should be preached in
hia name for the forgiveness of sina among all nations; and the beginning will be
from Jerusalem. Acts 2214-42, (verse 38, says REPENT). Acts 17216 - 31, (verse 30
says that God requires all men, everywhere to REPENT). 2nd Core/:10- For sorrow over
the things of God causes enduring repentance of the soul, and brings one to life;
but sorrow over the things of the world cayses deathe The sinner is dead in tres-
passes and sins until he or she REPENTS of the SIN of UNBELIEF and BELIEVES on the
Lord God Jesus Christ, hears His VOICE, comes to LIFE, and thus passes from death
into LIFEs REPENT, sinner friend, believe and confess God the Son as your SAVIOUR.

Mark 9343- If your hand offends you, cut it off; it is much better for you to
go through life maimed than to have two hands and go to Gehenna, 44-Where the embers
do not die and the fire does not go outs 45- And if your foot offends you, cut it
off; it is much better for you to go through life lame, than to have two feet, and
fall into Gehenna, 46- Where the embers do not die and the fire does not go oute 47-
And if your eye offends you, remove it; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of
God with one eye than to have two eyes and fall into the Gehenna of fire, 48- Where
the embers do not die, and the fire does not go oute Matthew 1828-9. Reve 20:11-15.

Luke 16319-31 States that there was a certain selfish, rich man, who used tc
wear purple and fine linen and every day he made mery very lavishly but he could not
stay here alive in this world and neither can wee After death is-the judgments Heb.
9227. He forgot to repent of his SIN of UNBELIEF and seek God for salvation, or else
he just kept putting off the time and neglecting to REPENT, BELIEVE and be SAVEDe He
died without repentance. The result was that in TORMENT, in an open flame of fire,
he lifted up his eyes, being sorely tormented by the firee He died in his SIN of UN-
BELIEFe He is yet in TORMENT, suffering excruciating agony; screaming for mercy, but
getting nonee He can never get out, nor can he ever have even as much as one seconc
of freedom from his excruciating agony in the fire, but must abide there in the FIRF
for all ETERNITY, just simply because he would not or did not REPENT, BELIEVE and te
SAVEDe The Lord God Jesué Christ, God the Son, died to save all who will repent anc
believe on Him for salvation, but not one who will note There is more joy in Heaver:
over one sinner that repents, than there is over ninety and nine just person who do
not need to REPENT, ieee self righteous personse Luke 1533-7 and Isaiah 64:6. The
Lord God Jesus Christ, God the Son, suffered His BLOOD to be SHED; laid His LIFE
down in our stead, that He might make a way possible whereby sinners can become re-
conciled to God the Father, be filled with God the Spirit, enjoy a glorious life in
this world, and escape that ewful place of TORMENT. Salvation gives us NEW LIFE in
New Jerusalem with Cod the Father and God the Son; filled with God the Spirit, there
in an immortal state, with the holy angels that kept their heavenly estate as our
S6rvaiitse This is for all people of all ages and nations, whosoever will} but not
even for as many as one who will not REPENT of UNBELIEF, BELIEVE and be SAVED. Amen.
