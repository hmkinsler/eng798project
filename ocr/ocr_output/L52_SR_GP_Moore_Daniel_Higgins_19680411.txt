Governor's Office
Raleigh, North Carolina

Dear Governor Moore:

This is to acknowledge with appreciation your appeal to
the churches of North Carolina as of April 6.

Now that the crisis is apparently passed at least for the
time being, I sincerely hope that North Carolina will move for-
ward to deal with the major issues that underlie the disturban-
ces of the last week. It was needful to call for the dispelling
of strife and for an end to violence, but the matter should not
end there. We must now move forward on a positive note to con-
structive action.

The action of the Mayor of Winston-Salem last night (April 10)
is the kind of action that is needed for our entire state. I
would appeal to you as the Governor of North Carolina to consider
some such action for the state as a whole.

As a life-long citizen concerned about our state, I would
appeal to you to;

1. Call upon industry in North Carolina to make a
common effort now to find jobs for as many of
the unemployed as possible, particularly those
in poverty areas.

Call upon the municipalities of North Carolina
to form urban coalitions such as Mayor Benton
is seeking to establish in Winston-Salem. In
this way the cities can seek to deal with their
local problems in a positive way.

Call upon the entire state to work for the elimi-
nation of other social ills such as inadequate
housing for the poor.

Call upon the candidates for public office in
this election year to conduct campaigns free of

racism. I have followed the campaign of the
many candidates carefully in these past weeks.
There is much in what I have heard so far that
gives rise to fear and misgiving and little that
encourages hope.

It is this latter point that disturbs me most. Too often
in North Carolina in recent years politicians are rewarded for
their negative stand on race. This leads the candidates to vie
with one another in their appeal to prejudice and racial ill
will. As example the present candidates for Governor are com-
peting to see who can make the strongest statements on riots
and violence. None apparently dares speak at all of our need
to deal constructively with the crisis that faces us as a state
and nation. Adequate law enforcement is vital, but is this all
that needs to be said?

The time for North Carolina to move to prevent riots next
summer is in May and June. It would be a great thing for our
state if you, as Governor, in an address to the people would
call upon all of us to rise above prejudice and ill will and
seek good will, understanding and peace.

Sincerely yours,

&
