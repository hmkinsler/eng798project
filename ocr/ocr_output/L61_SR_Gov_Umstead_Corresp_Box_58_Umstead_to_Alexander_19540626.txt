N. C. State Conference of N.A.A.C.P. Branches

Charlotte, North Carolina

Dear Mr. Alexander:

I acknowledge the receipt of your letter of June 14 with re-
ference to the decision of the Supreme Court regarding segregation in
public schools, which I have carefully read.

Iam not a member of the State Board of Education; however,
I wish to make it quite clear that Iam in thorough agreement with the
announcement made by the State Board of Education some time ago that
the schools in North Carolina will open in September on the same basis
upon which they have been operating.

I cannot agree that the questions and problems arising from
the decision of the Supreme Court are as simple or as easy to solve as
you indicated in your letter. I do not think the State Board of Education
should or will reconsider its announcement with reference to the opening
of the schools next fall.

With best wishes, Iam

Sincerely yours,

William B. Umstead

Dear Mr. Umstead:

On June 4, 1954, the Charlotte Observer carried a news item
reporting the Board of Education has unanimously agreed to operate the
North Carolina schools just as they have been operated in the past.

May I take this opportunity to remind you that the May 17 de-
cision of the United States Supreme Court announced a principle of con-
stitutional law in clear and unmistakable terms that segregated public
schools are violative of the Constitution of the United States. It seems to
us that this places upon our highest State officials a solemn duty of making
immediate plans to conform the school system of North Carolina to the
principle enunciated by the Supreme Court.

There are, of course, a few problems involved in the adoption
and implementation of a statewide plan of desegregation of the public schools
as is now required by the Supreme Court's decision. The administrative
problems involved in this are relatively easy of solution. This would merely
mean that some system would be adopted for the division of the school system
among the children of public school age in the state on a fair and equitable
basis and without regard to race and color,

The more complex problem which the Supreme Court decision
raises is the question of the adaption of the people of the State to a new way
of life since we have all been reared in a segregated system. Now we are
called upon to change that system into an integrated one, insofar as one of
our largest and most important public institutions are concerned--our public
schools.

We do not feel that this presents any overwhelming difficulties but
it is merely a question of adjustment of the individual to a new outlook. We are
certain that the people of our state can make this necessary adjustment without
undue friction. It should be pointed out that in every instance where schools
have adopted a policy of desegregation, the difficulty which had been anticipated
has not taken place.

May I refer you and the members of the Board to a most exhaustive
study of this problem which supports this point of view: Clark, Desegregation:
An Appraisal of the Evidence, Vol, IX, No. 4, The Journal of Social Issues,
1953.-

Even if our confidence in the people of our state is somewhat mis-
placed with respect to this question, you must agree that you do not deal with
the question by delaying it. Race relations in our state have been somewhat
better than in most other states of our region, and we are convinced that the
citizens of goodwill will be willing to aid and assist state and local officials in
adopting and implementing a plan for desegregation of the public schools.

There is no reason why we should wait for the Supreme Court to
give some indication whether it will require immediate desegregation or per-
mit gradual desegregation of the public schools. It would be to North Carolina's
advantage, if at this time, independent of the United States Supreme Court, it
would adopt a plan of desegregation and undertake to insure the public acceptance
of its program.

May I remind you that the State of West Virginia; Baltimore, Maryland;
Washington, D. C.; Greensboro, North Carolina; Topeka, Kansas, and a few

other communities have adopted, or, are adopting programs for desegregation
without awaiting decision by the United States Supreme Court.

I hope that the Board will reconsider this matter, and will call for
the help of citizens of goodwill of both races in the adoptim of a program which
would implement the principles announced by the Court.

As President of the State Conference of Branches of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Iam authorized to offer

the services of the NAACP to assist you in whatever way it can in devising an
effective program for desegregation of the public schools.

Very truly yours,
