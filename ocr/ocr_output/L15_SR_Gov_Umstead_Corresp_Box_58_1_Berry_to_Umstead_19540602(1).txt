Governor William Umsteade
uover:or's Mansion,
Raleigh, North Carolina.

My dear Governor Umstead,

I have been your loyal suvporter in your campaigns.
I took this stand because I believed you to be ea
Sincerely Christian man, and one devoted to the
democratic way of life.

I have been deeply nurt by your stand for segregation
Do you tnink when the Lord exanines 2a man's soul

He 1S going to ask the color of his skin? Do you
think a man's color should deprive him of any whit

of human dignity? Do you think when Christ blessed
the children that He bothered to inquire into their
ancestry first? Do you thgnk we can preach

democracy to others and refuse to vractice 1t
ourselves?

I an a twelvth generation Virginian and I love the
South passionately but I believe with Lowell that
"New occasions teach new duties;

"Time makes ancient good uncouth.

"ye must upward still and onward -

"ho would keep abreast of Truth.

I can only nope that you wili examine your con-
Science carefully, and that you will be xble to
reverse your stand on tnis matter.

Very sincerely caer
