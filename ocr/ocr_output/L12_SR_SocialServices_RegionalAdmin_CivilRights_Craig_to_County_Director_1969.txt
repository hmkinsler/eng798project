REVISED DRAFT

Dear County Director of Social Services:

On July 16, 1969 the North Carolina State Department of social Services
submitted a plan to the Regional Office of HEW, Civil Rights Division assuring
compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Our plan included .
procedures for a periodic review of Title VI compliance by county departments
of social services. One feature of our plan as approved by the Regional Office
is a study of comparative processing time for white, Indian and Negro applications
for public assistance, by category and by type of action.

In order to carry out this particular phase of our plan, the Research
and Statistics Section has agreed to prepare on a quarterly basis a report on
public assistance applications. The report contains data relative to the
average number of days taken to complete an application and number of applications
disposed of, by county and race.

I have received the report for the quarter ending June 30, 1969,
and would like to share with you some of the results of the report.

Data clearly indicated that on a Statewide basis it took longer to
process both Negro and Indian applications than it did white applications.
The difference in the time lapse between Negro and white applications is much
less than the difference between Indian and white applications. Although it

took 14 more days to process an Indian application than it did a Negro

application, the percentage of counties in which the time lapse was equal
to or less than that for whites was much higher for Indians than it was
for Negroes (44.4 percent for Indian vs. 29.0 percent for Negroes).

In one-fourth of the counties the difference between the time taken
to dispose of a Negro application and that for a white application was more
than 10 days. Furthermore, in all categories except AFDC-VPO the time taken
to process a Negro application was greater than that taken for a white
application. Data relative to type of action (approval, rejection, disposed
of other reasons) showed that in no instance was the time lapse for Negro

applications less than that for white applications.

It is realized that the processing of applications represents only one
of your many activities and that it would not be proper to assume that your
performance in this area is indicative of your total operation. However, I
do feel that the data presented in the report points up the need for a
closer look at the application process in many of our county agencies.

In working up this report, Research and Statistics provided me with
an individual county analysis for those counties in which the time lapse for
processing Negro applications was greater than 10 days more than that for
white applications. Your county is included. I am furnishing you with this
analysis (given below):

I am requesting that you furnish me with the following:

1) An explanation or justification for the difference in the
time for processing applications between whites, Negroes,
and Indians (if applicable).

2) Proposals as to what can be done about the situation in
the county.

I would appreciate an early reply.

Sincerely,

Clifton M. Craig
