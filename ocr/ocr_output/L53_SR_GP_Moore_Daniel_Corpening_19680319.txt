State of North Carolina
Raleigh, North Carolina

Dear Sovernor Moore:

Thank you very much for the booklet on the Sovernor's Confer-
ence on Community Relations and for the opportunity of participa-
tina in this conference. In light of your enclosed letter invit-
ing comments and suggestions, I am presuming to write to you.

Very candidly I feel that the conference itself was only a
beainning. Unless it is followed up both at tne local and state
levels, very little will have been accomplished. I realize, of
course, that the follow-up is largely up to local communities but
I also feel that through your good offices a number of things can
be done.

One thing which I feel is particularly important at both
local and state levels is to insure better lines of communication
between all facets of the community. In one community, for in-
stance, in a very unofficial, quiet way, a number of businessmen
are seeking to enter into conversation with leaders of the more
radical elements in the Negro community. It is the feeling of many
that tnis may create better understanding and at least provide some
kind of safety valve. As I indicated, this is being done very un-
officially and quietly. Any publicity to this kind of thing would
damage any positive outcome irreparably. What some are trying to do
locally could also be done by you at the state level. for instance,
while some would have serious reservations, I would hope that you
might invite some people such as Howard Fuller, Ben Puffin and other
such leaders across the state to sit down with you in siiall groups
to discuss the situation with your attitude being simply to listen.
I recognize that this is terribly presumptuous for me to even sug-
gest to you. At the same time, the possible help that such informal
and unofficial conferences mignt be is tremendous.

A second suggestion that might have some possibility is for
you through the Good Neighbor Council to sponsor a series of regional
conferences on conmunity relations which could serve as models for
local communities in dealing with problems. In such conferences you
might have the various elements of the community talking with each
other to exchange ideas, hammer out possible solutions to problems,
but most of all, to attempt to create an atmosphere in which conmu-
nication could take place. Representation at such meetings might

involve city administration, Chamber of Commerce, police, County
Commissioners, human relations groups, radical Negro leadership,
the church, and other groups. Each community ought to have a way
by which these various groups get together; however, few do. A
recional conference of this type could provide a kind of model
for individual communities to fol low.

Still another possibility that might be helpful is for there
to be some kind of clearing house on information as to what vari-
ous communities are doing to meet their problems. For instance,

I heard by way of the grapevine that one city in North Carolina
through its United Fund is attempting to provide camping opportuni-
ties for ghetto children on an entirely new basis for this summer.
I recognize that camping opportunities are small potatoes in terms
of the massive problems we face in urban situations. At the same
time, this is the kind of gesture of good will and good faith which
can go a long way toward alleviating some of the tensions and mis-
trust which exist. If this kind of information can be communicated
to appropriate people, it would enable all of our communities to
share in possible projects which could be helpful. This may already
be done at a level of which I am unaware. It is an idea which has
some merit, I think.

We are grateful for the leadership you are furnishing in North
Carolina, especially for your efforts in this very crucial area of
community relations. I am convinced that we as a state are in for
serious trouble in the months immediately ahead. Whether or not
anything could be done to head off some of the trouble remains to
be seen. I do think that it is imperative that everything possible
be done in this direction and, if such efforts fail, we will at
least have some means by which we can begin to pick up the pieces
after the trouble is over.

Sincerely you

Julius H. Corpeding

Dear Reverend Corpening:

Thank you for your letter and for your copinents and suggestions
on a meaningful program of community relationd. fl agree that the
conference held in Raleigh was only a beg g- We are attempting to
follow it up in various ways.

For instance, we have sent, as y√©u know, copies of speeches to
leaders throughout North Caroling. Addition we asked mayors and
county commission chairmen to ae nus for any assistance we might
render. Specially printed cards whye enclosed for their convenience
listing programs associated with employment, education, recreation

and housing. We have begun to receive requests from some local officials.

To follow up these requests, we have established what we cail an
Opportunity Group of selected State officials to contact and work with local
officials requesting assistance. I believe this will be a meaningful approach
and that it will enable the State to be of meaningful assistance to local
governments. We are hopeful that local government leaders will avail
themselves of this service.

I also agree with your opinion of the value of communication between
all facets of the community. As you know, this is one of the major purposes
of the Good Neighbor Council and its local counterparts. We have urged local
governments to establish these councils and to allow them to function in a
manner most beneficial to the individual communities.

We have also designated a member of my personal staff to work
in the area of communication. He is talking with local government leaders
as well as leaders in both Negro and white communittes to bring about a
better understanding of problems and potentials.

I also feel that your suggestion for a clearing house on information
has merit. I feel it is beneficial for community leaders to be aware of and
consider successful programs in other communities. I will give consideration
to implementing your suggestions in this area.

Again, Reverend Corpening, thank you fer yeur comments. I agree
with you as to the importance of our actions in the coming weeks and months.
I believe this is a period of opportunity for North Carolina and that we must
do everything possible to reap the benefits rather than its failures.

With best wishes,

Sincerely,

Dan Moore
