Honorable Dan Moore, Governor
State of North Carolina
Raleigh, North Carolina

Dear Governor Moore:

As a saddened, concerned and somewhat frustrated American whose racial
heritage is Negro, I cannot help but express to you my dismay at the lack
of creativeness which you show toward today's problems which are so
seriously wounding North Carolina.

Mr. Governor, there simply are not enough federal troops to occupy and safe-
guard all of America's towns; and, Heaven forbid, even if there were enough,
who can be sure that Negro soldiers will continue an allegiance to a system
the majority of whose leaders still speak as if "law and order" mean status
quo. May the human love and dedication which you seem unable to comprehend
but which Negro guardsmen, police and soldiers practice in these dangerous
times grow in those men of goodwill. May that growth look over and forgive
your constant tendency to overlook their loyalty to these United States of
America.

In the meantime, Mr. Governor, you can make some gestures which, though
criminally tardy, may so much help even now. Just being noticed would help
the corporate feelings of all Negroes in this State. Even as they have
already identified variously with white attitudes toward the late Dr. Martin
Luther King, Negroes here will beam with pride if you would only appoint a
sizeable number of Negroes to some significant state agencies. This gesture
will not hurt you, Mr. Governor, but it will help all of us so very much.

Can you imagine for one moment, Mr. Governor, the frustration a Negro youth
feels when he sees that his race's most talented men--holding all kinds of
terminal degrees from universities all over the nation--can never merit
appointment to even a handful of harmless state boards and committees. That
gesture can come only from you, Sir.

Force, promise of increasing force, determination to force with force will
hardly help us, Mr. Governor. But I urge you to try my suggestion which I
make in all seriousness and without malice. Give it a chance, Sir. I cannot
be any more wrong than your present course.

Very truly yours,

6

Mr. Walter C. Daniel

1911 Darlington Place
Greensboro, North Carolina
Deaz Mr. Daniel:

I have your letter of April 13, and I appreciate your wri

me.

I agree with you that there are not enough F
eccupy and safeguard all ef America's towns. I
&@ practice would, in nermal times, either pr
er encourage a better understanding between among the races. On
the other hand, when vielence and lawles s break out, it is the
primary business and responsibility of gofernment te restore and
maintain civil order, and te protect theives and preperty of innocent

troops to
@ never felt such
the general welfare

Carolina. I regret the circumstances
which have, from time to time, required me to eall eut the Highway Patrol
and the National Guard, but I believe that under those circumstances it
has been my respensibility te take the action whieh I took. J assure you
that I will net hesitate te take that action again if it becemes necessary.

On the other hand, since taking the oath of effice as Governor of
North Carolina, I have done everything in my power to promote s better
understanding between the races in North Carolina. I believe that we have
made significant strides in that direction. I regret that yeu are not
acquainted with the substantial number of prominent Negro citizens whem
3 have appointed to public office since my term began. I believe the record
will show that I have appointed more Negroes to more publie offices than

any Governor in the history of North Carolina. I have been proud to
appoint forty-two Negro citizens during my term and every day I am
loeking for qualified and competent Negroes who will answer the call
to public service. There are sixty-one boards, commissions or
committees which have Negro representation and they ere serving
admirably in making a contribution for a better life for all North
Carolinians. For yeur information, I enclose a list of the Negroes
whom I have been proud te appoint.

In addition to a continuing effort to draw qualified people of all
races into public life and to place them in positions of high public
responsibility, one of the goals of my administration has been and will
continue to be to offer increased State employment opportunities to
Negro citisene in North Carolina. I believe this administration has
employed more Negroes than any administration in the history of cur
State, and I can assure you tat it will continue to be my practice to
encourage the employment of qualified and able Negroes in State
government.

In spite of what you may believe, this has been and will continue
te be my course. I regret that you were not aware of it and I invite yeu
to join with me in the search of those Negroes in North Carolina who are
willing and able to give their time and talents te the betterment of life for
all people in North Carolina. I hope you will never hesitate to correspond
with me and to advise me of your thoughts and suggestions. I will welcome
the epportunity to continue to receive your views.

With best wishes, I am

Sincerely,

Dan Meere
