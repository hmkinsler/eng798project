Dear Governor Moore:

As Jewish Chaplain at Camp Lejeune, I received the telegram
which you sent to our Chapel following the tragic death of
Dr. Martin Luther King. Your worde of concern for peace among men
and an end to strife were most welcomes. You asked that we who
are clergyman speak to this problem from our pulpitse I can assure
you that this was done in our congregation and will continue to
be donee

In order to pursue the goal of closer communion among men
of diffrent races, it is obvious that concrete steps must by
taken to assure the Negro equal status in every phase of our
society from jobs to open housing to education to, if I may
say 30, open houses of worsnipe In this regard, I would like to
address my congregants in very specific terms, Any help that
your office can give to me would be most appreciated. Thus, if
you could let me know of the legislition which you plan to
of ferfin the coming weeks or months which will be aimed at correcti.z
the problems of racial inequity, I will do all that I can to back
such measures before my congrugationg

As a rabbi, I was most hanpy to see the obvious interest in
racial harmony which your telegram reflected, Knowing how busy
your office must be, any reaponse that you can give to this
letter will be humbly appreciated.

Sincerely, J 4))

premotion ef greater oppertunity ior/all men.

Ae a new Governer will be e befere the convening of the
next General Assembly, 5 de not ‘prepose any new legislation to meet
our problerne. I feel that we have by and large the necossary legislation
on the books, and we are simply trying to iu.piement policies and
pregrams which will help correct the problems which cenfront our State.

On the one hand, we are enforcing laws against intinidation of any
citisen which were enacted by the last General Assembly at my request.
On the ether hand we are advancing a variety of programs designed
specifically te assist low-income families fa such areas as housing,
recreation, employment and educatioa. Our State Good Neighbor Couneil
has expanded ite efforts at promoting human relations.

ide act mean te imply, hewever, that the probleme are coming to
anend. We have a long ways to go in Nerth Carolina and I fee! this is
true of every nation as a whele. However, we do recognise the problems
exist and we are utilising our resources as wisely as possible is briaging
about solutions te these probleme. The job involves more than Goverament.
on the various levels. We must have a recognition of problems within the
various commanities of the State and a willingness asnong our people to
cock the advancement of human dignity. Our churches and synagegues have
an impertaat rele te play ia thie respect.
