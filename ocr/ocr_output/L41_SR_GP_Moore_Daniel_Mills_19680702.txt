Ann Newton's Epistle Christmas 1967
Easter 1968

Dear Friends,

At this momentous and tragic time in the life of man-
kind, the life of our nation, and the personal lives of Americans,
I find it fitting to beseech each to search his conscience and to
come to grips with himself once and for all. There must be a
rededication where there is dedication, and dedication where
none exists or where there is silent toleration of man's inhuman-
ity to man.

Like Christ, Who lived upon this earth but a short time,
Martin Luther King, Jr., taught us that if we would have peace
we must learn to live with each other, regardless of our differ-
ences. Mankind grieves over this assassination of a great
American, the second in a short time. We remember also the
many Other innocents who gave their lives for the cause of
justice and freedom -- the children in the church bombing;
the Civil Rights workers in Mississippi; Edgar Medgars;
Colonel Penn.

These crimes bare the soul of our nation's shame before
the world. If this great tragedy serves to shake us out of our
lethargy to complete the unfinished task for which Dr. King gave
his life, we can become a mighty force for justice and brother-
hood. [If this can be accomplished, and it must, this tragedy
and untimely passing will not have been in vain.

And so at this critical period in our lives, I send you
my love and best wishes. Let us reaffirm our faith and work
toward the day when every man shall be free to hold his head
high and to walk with pride and dignity in this our native land.

Miss Mary Mills

Washington, D.C.

Dear Miss Mills:

Thank you for -rour letter about the tragic death of Dr.
Marti. Luther King, aud the need for civil rights leyislation
and effective action to alleviate the problems of extreme pov-
ert: ard deprivation in the United States toda,. I appreciated
your taking the time to write to me and let me know tmt you
share my deep concern in this vital matter.

I believe that the time for bold and ineginative action
is now. We mst not delay efforts to eliminate the deprivaticn
and alienation of the ghetto, and mst take steps to insure that
Negro Americans, and other victims of povert, in the United States,
have an adequate dict, improved education, opportunities for em-
ployment, and decent housing. We must act to break the vicious
cycle of dependency and hopelessness in which too mam, of our
fellow ‘Americans are trapped, and all of us must make a greater
commitment to the achievement of these goais.

we can, of course, be encouraged by the passage of civii
rights legislation. I ws pleased to have your words of support
for the Civil Rights bill recently passed by Congress and sigmed
into law. As zou my know, I supported cloture motions and the
open housing provisions considered during Senate debate on the
bill, and voted for final passage of H. R. £516. I am sure you
were pleased, as J ws, that the House adopted these oper housirge
provisions.

This legislation will help, but Ccngress and private
citizens must also take action to insure that other effective
means to deal with these problems are developed and funded. You
may know that I have introduced legislaticn to encourage private
investment in housing and industrial development in urban areas.
I believe that this is one of the steps we must take. I am glad
to know that I shall heave your support for programs which will
help to mike equality of opportunity a reality for all Americans.

Again, my thanks and my best wishes to you.
Sincerely,

ANN NEWTON EPISTLE | JUNE 1968

Dear Friends:

In so short a time, I must reach out to you once more, Only a month
ago, I received a letter from the late Senator Robert Francis Kennedy
in reply to the Martin Luther King letter. The letter which marked the
tragic and untimely loss of that great American was circulated in many
countries overseas and to friends and concerned persons here in America.
I share with you the first paragraph of his letter:

"Dear Miss Mills: Thank you for your letter about the tragic death
of Dr. Martin Luther King, and the need for civil rights legislation
and effective action to alleviate the problems of extreme proverty and
deprivation in the United States today. I appreciated your taking the
time to write to me and to let me know that you share my deep concern
in this vital matter,"

Robert Francis Kennedy, could it be that he had reached his zenith?
Certainly, his impact upon the world and the lives of Americans in
particular shall serve as a mighty force in the triumph for justice,
we pray. He was at peace with himself and His Father. He had committed
himself to the fulfillment that he was his brother's keeper. By pro-
viding clothes for the naked, food and drink for the poor, sharing with
the stranger, his concern for the sick, for the widows and the orphans,
for those in the twilight and for the young; truly it can be said of
him as in Matthew 25:40 "'as you did it to one of the least of these

my brothern, you did it unto me."

He was a selfless man and like Elijah he took a position and made
a stand for his convictions. Like Abraham Lincoln, he was unable to
compromise with injustice. He was a man who was grieved for the cause
of decency. It was not sufficient for him to sit by and do nothing
about it.

The day is short, the task is long; it may or may not be

our lot, individually to finish the task;

Still we have a responsibility, you and I, and like runners

in-some remote hinterland village in Africa whose task it

is to take the message and run with it to the next village,

there it is taken from him by another runner who continues

to run toward the next village and onward to its destination.

At no time does the message rest along the way enroute. And

so it is with us, we must carry the lighted torch handed us

our length of the way, not knowing how long or how far we

will be permitted to go. Most important is what we do with

those days that we are entrusted with the torch.

Like Lincoln and to so many others who had a vision and a dream
that this great NATION of ours MUST fulfill its destiny that all men
are created equal and that he had a role in its destiny, he was felled
by an assassins's bullet. He left us in spectacular fashion; mankind
will forever be reminded with startling impact of the virture, the humil-
ity, his day to day ups and downs, his day to day greatness and of his

love for us .... that he laid down his life in the service of his country.
And so again I beseech you that there be a rededication where there
is dedication, and dedication where none exists or where there is silent

toleration of man's inhumanity to man. L040
