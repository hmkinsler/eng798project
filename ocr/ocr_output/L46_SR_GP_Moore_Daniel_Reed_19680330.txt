Raleigh, N. C.

Dear Governor Moore:

That such things as rioting in our streets can pass under the screen of
"Peaceful March" is disgraceful. Someone is bound to be responsible and
in this case it is Martin L. King. And he should have to be responsible
for the damages rather than the insurance companies.

We don't need a commission's report on rioting. Wrongs done in the past
can't be paid off, or made up for by "hand outs". The only way to improve
our society is to teach end preach that each citizen is a responsible
citizen. And "Do unto others as #6 would have them do unto you".

We are not all responsible for the riots we had last summer and are expecting.

If there is no law under which leaders and participators in riots can
be prosecuted there should be such a lew.

Why not make it a requirement that a "responsibility paper" be signed
by a person, or persons, before a demonstration of any kind can be held. Or

better yet have each participator to sign.

Very truly yours,

Mrs. C. H - Reed

Dear Mrs. Reed:

Thank you for your letter and for yout comments on demonstrations
and riots. I certainly agree with your e6mments that "the only way to
impreve our seciety is to teach and preach that each citizen is a
responsible citizen, and do wate site re as you would have them do unto
you."

Xarlier this ygar we Meld a Conference on Community Relations.
At that meetiag we fine ed responsibilities that all people have as
citiseas af thie e@ recognise that problems do exist and we
dedicated ourselves #6 equitable solutions.

There are, of course, laws against looting and burning and other
acts of violence. As is evident frem the recent trouble in many North
Carolina cities, violators of these laws will be arrested and preeecuted.
Certainly every effort will be made to see that the laws are enforced fairly
and firmly, and that the rights of all people will be protected.

With best wishes, I am

Sincerely,

Dan Moore
