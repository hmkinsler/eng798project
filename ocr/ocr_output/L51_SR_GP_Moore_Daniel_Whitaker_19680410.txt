Dear Governor Mocre:

Thank you for your telegram to the clergy urging our
efforts to bring peace and order to our communities.

I assure you that the clergy of Salisbury ana of Rowan
County are working diligently to that end. Enclosed is

a copy of the bulletin for the Community Memorial Service
held last Sunday evening for Dr. King. In a packed and
over-flowing church, a congregation that inclused at
least. one-third white persons sought to give expression
to our unity in Christ.

I hope, now, that you will use every influence of your
Office not only to restore peace and order to our
communities but also to ceal courageously and immediately
with the social causes for the restlessness in the Negro
soul today. It seems to me that a similar appeal now to
the congregations of our State to work for the rights of
all men would offer a great impetus and bring needed
prestige to the movement to guarantee to every man the
opportunity to develop the full potentials of his humanity.

Ein' Feste Burg

A mighty fortress is our God,
A bulwark never failing;
Our helper he amid the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing:
For still our ancient foe
Doth seek to work us woe;
His craft and power are great,
And, armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.

Did we in our own strength confide,
Our striving would be losing;
Were not the right man on our side,
The man of God's own choosing:

Dost ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is he;
Lord Sabaoth his Name,
From age to age the same,
And he must win the battle.

And though this world, with devils filled,
Should threaten to undo us;

We will not fear, for God hath willed
His truth to triumph through us:

The prince of darkness grim,

We tremble not for him;

His rage we can endure,

For lo! his doom is sure,
One little word shall fell him.

That word above all earthly powers,
No thanks to them, abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours
Through him who with us sideth:
Let goods and kindred go,
This mortal life also;
The body they may kill:
God's truth abideth still,
His kingdom is for ever.
(hartin Luther, 1529)

RE -DEDICATION Led by the Rev. C'Kelley vhitaker
Rector, St. Luke's Episcopal Church

I saw the Lord beside a mountaineer's cottage. He looked
at the dirty, blond-haired children, under-nourished,
under-educated, suspicious of strangers. He was wonder-
ing what chance these children would have in a highly
competitive society. I heard the voice of the Lord,
Saying: Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then
Said I,

Here am I, send me.

I saw the Lord, walking in the midst of children fighting
in the hallways of their schools These children knew
they were unable to keep pace with children in other
schools. They could read, but not well enough. Their
textbooks did them no good. The school library might as
well have been printed in Sanskrit. Knowledge was locked
up in those books. As he looked at these children who
read so poorly, I heard him say: Whom shall I send, and
who will go for us? Then said I,

Here am I, send me.
I saw the Lord on a brownstone step. He listened while

the men around him spat out their hatred for a society in
which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. He
heard them bitterly denounce 2 world that refused to loan
them money to start a little business so they could stand
on their own two feet. Also, I heard him muttering:

Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I,

Here am I, send me.

I saw the Lord in the midst of older children, seeking
for meaning in life, seeking for him, though they knew
him not. They were dirty, unattractive, and strange.
They were turned on, tuned in, and dropped out. The Lord
said: ‘hom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then
said I,

Here am I, send me.

I saw the Lord in the midst of minority groups all over
the world. They were the powerless, who could not Scoop
up for themselves the necessities of life which the
affluent society produces in abundance. They were the
voiceless who have no speaker in parliament, in congress,
or in the legislature. As he thought upon the powerless,
he said: Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?
Then, said I,

Here am I, send me.

We see you Lord as you have always been, surrounded by
publicans and sinners, by harlots and lepers. You came
to seek and to save that which was lost. We, who are
your deaicated and devoted followers, acknovledge that
we are your agents so that the illiterate may read: so
that the hungry may buy food; so that the penniless can
gain capital; so that the powerless may have hope. We
acknowledge all of this, Lord, and we see beth ourselves
and our church as your agent in service to the world.
Lord, we have heard your voice calling: ‘thom shall I
send, and who will go for us; and we answer,

Here am I, send me.

Where cross the crowded ways of life,
Where sound the cries of race and clan,
Above the noise of selfish strife,
ie hear thy voice, C Son of man,

In haunts of wretchedness anc need,
On shadowed thresholds dark with fears,
From paths where hide the lures of greed,
ve catch the vision of thy tears.

From tender childhood's helplessness,
From woman's grief, man's burdened toil,
From famished souls, from sorrow's stress,
Thy heart hath never known recoil.

O Master, from the mountain Side,

make haste to heal these hearts of pain;
Among these restless throngs abide,

C tread the city's streets again;

Till sons of men shall learn thy love,
ind fullow where thy feet have trod:

Till glorious from thy heaven above,
Shall come the city of our God. ‘men.

Lead on, O King eternal,

The day of march has come;
Henceforth in fields of conquest
Thy tents shall be our home:

Through days of preparation
Thy grace has made us strong,
And now, © King eternal,
We lift our battle-song.

Lead on, © King eternal,
Till sin's fierce war shall cease,
And holiness shall whisper
The sweet Amen of peace;
For not with swords loud clashing,
Nor roll of stirring drums,
But deeds of love and mercy,
The heavenly kingdom comes.

Lead on, O King eternal:
We follow, not with fears;

For gladness breaks like morning
Where'er thy face appears.

Thy cross is lifted o'er us;
@ journey in its light:

The crown awaits the conquest;
Lead on, O God of might!
