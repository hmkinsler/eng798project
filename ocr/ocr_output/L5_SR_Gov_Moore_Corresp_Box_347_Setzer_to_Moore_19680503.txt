Dear oir:

The recant slaying of Dr, Martin Luther King has precipitated
considerable concern and discussion among the members of the
bieracial Scotland County Ministers! Fellowship.

Determined to dispense with fruitless rhetoric and to generate
responsible and constructive action, the ministers, in a series
of study sessions, have hammered out concrete recommendations
for social progress, some of which we submit to you in the
enclosad Resolution.

We urge your serious Consideration to this enclosure and invite
your studied response,

God's blessing to you in your important area of service.

Cordially,

RESOLUTION OF THE SCOTLAND COUNTY MINISTERS' FELLOWSHIP ADDRESSED TO

GOVERNOR DAN MOORE AND OTHER ELECTED STATE OFFICIALS

We recognize that Governor Dan Moore, in the recent crisis, acted decisively
and responsibily and would commend him for his level-headedness in this. We
also recognize that his re-appointment of Mr, David 5. Coltrane at the beginning
of his term of office was one of his more significant acts. We feel however that
limiting Mr. Coltrane's duties to being “one who puts out fires and cools down
ashes" is too limited an approach to the deep-seated racial and economic problems
of our day. We feel that the approach has been negative especially in that the
advisory Committes hes been so "blue-ribbon" that it does not really know the needs
and the feelings of the group it is supposed to be giving advice about. We would 9
call upon the governor and all other elected state officials to begin a positive
approach to a program which will include a revamping of the objectives of Coltrane's
office; a spreading of the membership of his advisory committee to more adequately
reflect end deal with the grass-roots problems of both urban and rural sections
of our state and the people; and better liaison with every department of state
sovernment that they may join with Coltrane's office in pursuing a positive
approach to identifying and dealing with the various aspects of the problem.

We ask that state officials make available regularly through press releases and
other suitable means the current data on employment in the various departments of
state government and the national guard; and that this be done by categories, i.e.,
professional, sub-professional, non-professional, clerical, etc., and that the
number of non-white in each category of each department be clearly shown. Te also
ask that each department of state government make available on the same basis
information on the policies and programs it has by which it's employees may con-

tinue to upgrade their skills and proficiency in order to qualify for promotion.

We call on our elected representatives to confront seriously the need for a
revision of our state constitution and our state statute laws so that there shall
be real equality and justice under law for all people in our state.

We urge all elected and appointive state officials to give highest priority to
seeking better methods of dealing with the inequalities of education, housing and

job opportunities too many of the people of our state live with every day.
The Reverend C. Peter Setzer

Dear Reverend Setzer:

Thank you for your letter and enclosed resolution of the Scotland County
Ministers! Fellowship. I appreciate your suggestions and I am pleased to report
that the State has long since moved in the direction suggested,

First, Mr. Coltrane's duties and the responsibilities of the Good Neighbor
Council have been expanded during this Administration to far move than “putting
out fires and cooling down ashes." I agreed with you: Ahat that was a "too
limited approach" to the problems confronting North Carolina in this area.
Consequently, the role of the Good Neighbor Council has been broadened and it
has been made a statutory body. fo

f

More specifically, the Good Neighbér Council has staff people working to
assist with the establishment of local good neighbor or human relations councils;
in the development of community relations; in promoting equal employment
opportunities not only in State Gove nment, but in private businesses. Far more
time and effort are spent by the staff of the Good Neighbor Council in preventing
"fires" by eliminating causes than in "putting out fires,"

The resolution forwarded to me also commented on current data on
employment of various departments of State Government. This information is
and has been made available to the public through the State Personnel Department
and the North Carolina Employment Security Commission. Ihave personally
met with the heads of major State agencies emphasizing to them that North
Carolina is an equal opportunity employer. If you know of anyone seeking a
job with State Government who has not received fair treatment, I would
appreciate your informing me of the specifics.

I also would point out that at my suggestion a study is presently under way
of the North Carolina State Constitution. The Constitution is 100 years old
this year and has been amended on the average of once per year. I have
emphasized that the Constitution should be reviewed and updated to better
serve the people of North Carolina in this period.

Finally, I have long ago complied with your request that "higher priority"
be given to seeking better education, housing and job opportunities for the people
of this State. This is basic to the concept of total development. More specifically,
I would point out that we have provided all-time high expenditures in all areas of
education--public schools, community colleges and higher education. I[ call
your attention to the open-door policy and the opportunity in the community
college system, which now has a unit within commuting distance of over 85 per
cent of our people, and the $1 million fund I requested to supplement programs
aathe traditionally Negro institutions of higher learning. This is over and above
regular appropriations for these institutions. [have also initiated studies of
higher education and the public schools to find ways of strengthening the State's
programs in these areas.

Housing has been a major concern of this Administration. We have
established a committee on low-income housing and added a specialist in
housing to the State Planning Task Force. This specialist has worked with
local governments in developing public housing programs; with private industry
in the development of plans for low-income housing; and with various private,
civic and church groups in developing housing programs for needy families, If
your Ministers’ Fellowship is interested in knowing more about or participating
in any of these programs, I suggest that you write Mr. Luther C. Hodges,
Housing Specialist, State Planning Task Force, Raleigh, North Carolina. I
might add here that private insurance companies in North Carolina have made
available, at my suggestion, about $15 million for loans at low rates to low-
income families for housing.

Job opportunities, I feel, are the key solution of many of our problems in
this area. For this reason we have actively participated in the sbhand industrial
program for the State. This, too, has proceeded at a record rate creating not
only more, but better jobs for our citizens. Here again education is important
and I would urge you to help prepare citizens for better job opportunities through
support of stay-in-school efforts, and by working directly with disadvantaged
people, particularly young people, to get them to take advantage of training
and education opportunities in the community college system. The jobs are .
here for those who are willing to take advantage of training opportunities.

Iam enclosing for your information a copy of the speeches made at the
Governor's Conference on Community Relations held in Raleigh in February.
At that Conference we recognized opportunities in the area of community
relations and the responsibilities of every segment of our society to contribute
to the fulfillment of this opportunity. I particularly call your attention to the
remarks made by Reverend L. Powers McLeod. My remarks at the Conference
will give you additional information on some of the prog#ams presently under
wawin Navrth Carolina,

Finally, l am enclosing copies of recently announced programs to find
summer employment for 100, 000 high school and college students in North
Carolina and a companion program to keep public echool recreation and shop
facilities open throughout the summer. Your support, endorsement and
participation in these programs as well as ail others aimed at the advancement
of human betterment and dignity will be appreciated.

Again, thank you for your letter and your support of the State's effort
in providing a better way of life for every man, woman and child in North
Carolina.

With best wishes, I am

Sincerely,

Dan Moore
