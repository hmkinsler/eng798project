The Hon. Dan K. Moore
Office of the Governor
Raleigh, NC 27602

Dear Governor Moore:

We were pleased to have your telegram to the clergy and laity of North
Carolina, concerning the death of Martin Luther King, called to our
attention and praised by one of our ministers.

Further, we were pleased that in maintaining order in the State with a
minimum of force and loss of life you have done the necessary. Maintaining
order alone, however, is not sufficient. We, of white America, must now
act so that pious words eulogizing Dr. King are followed by forthright
steps that will lead to jobs and thus to food, clothing, and decent
shelter for unemployed, underemployed, and unemployable persons in this
State, both black and white.

It seems to us that your position as a governor who may not seek a second
term puts you in an especially strong position to promote bold programs

during your remaining period in office. Four years ago you went before the
electorate asking to serve them and to receive the prestige and gratifications
of the office of Governor. Now, we call upon you to lead the citizens of

this State through a period of reconcilliation into a better time measured

by their well-being.

For example, you have the power to change employment practices in State
government, from the stock room and supply service through the Highway
Patrol and National Guard, into administrative positions at all levels in
all departments; we have read recently of some of your plans in this area,
now let us hear of actions. Let'us hear, for example, of Negroes being
appointed to the judiciary.

Further, let us have some special programs to provide employment, income,
training, and thus self-respect, for youth. Let us dip into the budget surplus
to provide these things rather than merely to pay for quelling riots and
rebuilding after wanton destruction resulting from frustration and emotienal
action.

We call upon you to press your staff into action; to put programs of this
sort into operation within the month and to keep them going and growing
throughout the summer and into next year. We call upon you to support the
work of economic opportunity groups, helping to redirect them where they can
be improved. We urge you to take up the burden of leadership that goes with
the governorship and lead the State into a period of cooperation and relative
economic advancement for our less well-to-do citizens.

Sincerely yours, foe
