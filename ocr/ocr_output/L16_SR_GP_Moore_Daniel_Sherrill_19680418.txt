Governor of North Carolina
Raleigh, North Carolina

Dear Sir:
This is to acknowledge your telegram of April 6.

I can appreciate your sentiments in wishing for peace,
order and a harmonious relationship between the races.

I do regret, however, that your expression of concern
did not come before the tragedy and the resulting
violence occurred. If it had, perhaps some of the
violent acts which took place could have been averted.
Your recent efforts toward better human relations, in
other words, would have been more meaningful in the
early days of your administration.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Dr. Sherrill:

Thank you for your letter acknewledging eipt ef my telegram
ef April 6. The telegram, ef course, was ia
death of Dr. King and was an urging for all mgn of all races to frdlow
teachings which he espoused.

I do not feel that my actien yard was eut ef place or
that it was any change of course for my Administration. A major purpose
of my Admihictration hae been to dmorgve human relations and te previde
greater Opportunity for all of our citi - This priacinle was one stated
in my inaugural address and is one which I have followad. Although much
mere remains to be done, I do believe we have made progrens in these
areas.

I will not attempt to caumerate all of the «fforts in this regard. I
would eall to your attention, however, the fact that the Good Neighbor
Council has become a statutory body at my recommendation, and that laws
have been enacted against the intimidation of any citizen. These iacluded
making cross burning en private oreperty witheut permission of the owner
& felony, end increased the penalties fer bembing occupied preperty. Other
programs have incladed the strengthening of educational programs for all
citisens, including the broadeniag of the community college program and a
opecial $0, 000,000 apprepriation over and aheve regular apprepriatica fer
use by the traditionally Negro colleges. Housing, recreation aad ether
programs have been initiated whieh I feel have had special meaning to lower
income families ef all races.

Dr. Sherrill, | had net intended te make a defense for my Administration
in this letter. I de feel that the record if examined closely will indicate to all
Nerth Carelinians that the telegram following Dr. King's death earlier this

month was not » chance in noltlev. but rather a continuation af our afforta to

provide greater opportunity for all citizens in an atmosphere of
cooperation.

With best wishes, I am
