Honorable William Â©. Umstead, Governor
oteate of North Carolina
Raleish, North Carolina

Dear Governor Umstead:

tL am glad to read in the papers that you have made a
satisfactory recovery and that you are able to be
back in your office again. I trust that your health
will remain good because, certainly, 4 you will need
it and many other sources of strength. during the
comings Six months,

i,a8 well as most others, have been considerably dis-
curbed since the Supreme Court decision on segresation,.
I have given it considerable thousht, and especially
after reading the stated objectives of the National
Association for the Advance ienc of Colored People. Lt
seems that the chief objective of that organization is
the complete mongrelization of the races, in which

case there would be no more white and no more colored,
Abolition of segregation in the schools sesms to be
only a step in their prosram,

i do not Wis h to take anything away Prom them nor to
deprive them of any right of equal oppor tunity, DUT

ac the same time, l feel no obliration to rraternize
with them personally or throusch our children, just to
make them feel better. tI do not pretend to know just
what the outcome is going to be concerning our schools,
but if the worst comes to the worst and sersresation
does have to be abolished in the schools, we have one
fort left, and that is separation of the sexes. Under
no circumstances, can we in this state ever allow both
races and sexes to Srow up together in the public
schools, to fraternize, and 50 attend social functions
tosether, because this would cradually eventuate into

matrimony and the attainment of their chief objective,

mongrelization, The only time to stop that is before
lt is too late, Certainly, the Supreme Court could
not pass another law and keep us from separatins the
sexes in public schools,

lt have already talked to Tom Pearsall about this, and
Lan sure that it is in the minds of many others,
