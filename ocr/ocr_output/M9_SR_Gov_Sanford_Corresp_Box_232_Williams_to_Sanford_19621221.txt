After his departure frem wlizgabeth City to Hertford and wdenton, sergeant
Lane, Vorporal teiges, Troopers Rawls and Cook kept the motorcade uncer
close surveiliance.

At the completion of his Speaking engagement in taenton, neverend King
departed at 12:30 A.M. on the 2lst and went directly to the North varolina-
Virginia Line, travelling north on Us 17.

The Mayor of bdenton introduced reverend King at his arpearance at the
Armory in bdenton, Chief of Folice in tdenton, Mr. Labole, was at the
Armory for the entire time of the speaking engagement. He escorted
Reverend King to another place where they nad a closec door session with
tne local wegro ministers and otner NAACP officials. after tnis meeting,

Reverend King departed from Kadenton ana suosequently ieft worth Carolina.

Corooral Meiggs that Keverena LaGarde told him the Highway Fratrol really

let him cown on this important assignment by not escorting Reverend King
to and from tdenton from the Virginia Line.

On three different occasions, Sergeant Lane met with the FBL, who were
very much concerned with Neverencd King arriving and departing from North
Carolina safely and during this motorcade from the time it arrived in
North VCarolina until it departed. keverena King was Kept under close
surveillance by #Bl Agents.

Throughout tne entire visit of Reverend King, the four Sighwey Fatrol cars
asSilgnea to keep Reverend King and the motorcace under close surveillance,
were in @ poSition at &li times to intercede in case & ailificulty arose.
sergeant Lane will contact Reverend LaGarde and again explain the Highway
Patrol policy regarding escort and explain the surveillance oy the Highway
Fatrol involved more personnel and was more effective for the tore

obviously important aspects of this type than a simpler escort would have
involved. In addition to tre four Patrol cars assigned to tne surveillance,
all the cars in the DiStrict were alerted and availiable.

as
An

The Highway Patrol, City Police, sheriff Department, and the BI had
several meetings and briefed their officers under their command on the
entire operation and coordination, and was carried out eitticientiy, tne

main objective being to assure Reverend King safe travel in wortn varoiina.
This was achieved.
