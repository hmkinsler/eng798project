Honorable William B. Umstead muses

Governor of North Carolina
raleigh, North Carolina

Dear Governor Umstead:

In the memorandum which 1 sent you yesterday mentioning
some of the questions which may arise in connection with the
decision of the United States Supreme Court in the segregation
cases, 1 mentioned the possible questions which might arise of
Civil or criminal penalties under the Federal Civil Rights Act.
I requested Mr. Cogburn of my staff to make a study of this
question and I am enclosing you copy of the memorandum which
he furnished me. I am inclined to believe that the conclusions
which he states, beginning on page 9, are correct but, as in all
other cases involving civil rights in our Supreme Court, the
results are unpredictable. Some of the judges now composing
this august tribunal have voted sustaining practically every
civil right which has been asserted in cases reaching that
court. With the trend of decisions now apparent, it is difficult
if not impossible to say what they may decide in any case of
this character,

You will observe that Mr. Cogburn reaches the conclusion
that until the Supreme Court has finally issued the decrees in
the cases of BROWN v. EOARD OF #IUCATION and other cases, after
the reargument for which the cases have been docketed, he does
not think that the so-called Civil Fichts provisions could be
enforced by civil or criminal sanctions.

I thought that this was a very interesting angle to our
problem.

With highest regarcs, I am
Sincerely yours,

PROM; MAX COGRURN

You have reaquested that 1 read the segregation opinion
recently handed down by the Supreme Court of the United
States in tne cases involving the public scnools. You pointed
out tnat tnere may be some difficulty arising as to what
action officials of the State of North Carolina are to take
in view of the deciSion.e. You asked that 1 look into possible
Vioiations of the soexcalled Civil Kignts Act by officials who
find 10 necessary to take action with relation to the matter
of segregation in the public schools of this state.

I have read tne opinion in tne case of BROWN V. BOARD

4
_t

HOUCATLION OF TOPEKA COUNTY and the other caseS wnicn were
consolidated with it by the Supreme Court for the purpose:

of decision. tn the Brown case, tne Kansas statute involved
permitted but did not require segregation in the public schools.
The other three cases involved statutes and constitutional
provisions which require segregation of the races in public
schools. It would appear that the opinion of the Court nolds
that segregation in the public schools because of race is a
deprivation of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by
the Fourteenth Amendment whether the State law requires such
segregation or simply permits it.

I shall first direct my attention to the appropriate
Pederal civil rights statutes for violation of wnich criminal
penalties are provided. U. S. CG. A. Title 78 Section 2 provides:
“Whoever, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation,
or custom, wilfully Subjects any inhabitant of any State,
lerritory, or District, to the deprivation of any rights,

privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution
or laws of the United States. . . Snall be fined not more tnan
$1000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both." It
will be notea that this statute covers any innabitant of any
state, territory, or district. in U. §. VS. CLASSIC, 313

U. S.~ 299, the Supreme Court held that this provision is
Violated by tne deprivation of any constitutional rignt
without regard to whetner the deprivation was on account of
the injured person's color or race. The constitutionality

of this statute was questioned in SCREWS V. U. S., 325 U. S.
Ql,which was decided in 1945. The facts in the Screws case
may be summarized briefly as follows: Screws was sneritf

of Baker County in Georgia. Assisted by a policeman and a
deputy sneriff ne arrested a Negro for the theft of a tire.
When the officers arrived at tne court house witn tne Negro
in custody tney began beating him with their fists and a
blackjack and continued this for about 30 minutes until he
was unconscious. He was then cragged into tne jail and then
later taken tc tne hospital where he died within an hour
without regaining consciousness. Screws was indicted for
Violation of this eivil rights statute, was found suilty,

and this judgment was affirmed by the Court cof Apveals of

the United States. When this case came on for argument before
the Supreme Court of the United States Screws! attorney
argued that this statute was unconstitutional. His theory
was roughly tnis: this statute seeks to make criminal a
Violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. lhe due process clause has been broadly defined
by the Supreme Court. This vagueness otf the due vorocess clause
is imported into the statute with the result that the Statute
Sets no ascertainable standard of guilt. Since our system

ol government requires that criminal statutes be specific,

Ce
tnis statute must tail for the reason that it establishes
no ascertainable standard of guilt. The Supreme Court held
tne statute is constitutional but in orcer to do so it neld
shat in a prosecution under this statute the triai court must
instruct the jury and the jury must find that the defendant
not only nad a generaily bad purpose motivating his action
but tnat in addition ne was motivated by tne purpose and a
specific intent to deprive a person of a federal right made
definite by aecision or other rule of law. The Court further
pointed out that "in determing whether that requisite bad
purpose was present the jury wouid be entitled to consicer
all the attendant circumstances”. (225 U. S. 91, 107) It
may be worthwhile to point out how the members of the Court
split in this case. Justices Douglas, Stone, Black, Reed,
Nnutledge, anc Murpny agreec that the statute was constitutional.
Justices Hoberts, Frankfurter and Jackson dissented on two
grounds. In tne first piace, they felt that the Act is
unconstitutional because of its indefiniteness and vagueness.
In tne second place, they contended that even if tne Act be
treated as consti tutional that it was intended by Congress
to apply only to that unconstitutional conduct of state
officers which has been authorized by state law but not to
such conduct whicn is opposed to state law. The majority
of the Court held that Screws: could be convicted even though
his actions were in violation of the law of Georsia. screws
mad contended tnat ne was acting in violation of law and
therefore not "under color of law" but the majority of the
Court rejected this argument.

Very few cases have been brought under thisstatute. It
may perhaps be said that federal officials have been and will
be somewhat reluctant to proceed against state officials under

this statute. It is true that federal judges are apvointed

by the President for life (or during good behavior) but it is

Attorney is tne person who has discretion to initiate criminal

the Department of Justice Should see fit to look into the
conduct of his office. - Furthermore, a jury in such a case
wouid be drawn from citizens of North Carolina and these
citizens would be reluctant to indict or convict local
officers in doubtful cases.

In the case of WILLIAMS V. U. S., 341 U. S. 97, the
Supreme Court held tnat tnere nad been a viclation of this
statute wnere the operator of a detective agency who held
a special police officers'car issued by a municipality, had
taken tne oath as a police oltficer, and nad conducted an
investigation of a theft during the course of which ne used
brutal metnods to obtain a confession from certain suspects.

As pointed out earlier, it is clear tnat an officer
acts under color orf law whether or not he is acting pursuant
to state law or in violation of tnat Law.

Title 16 U.S.C.A., Section 21, provides in part as
follows: "If two or more persons conspire to injure,
oppress, threaten, or intimidate any citizen in the free
exercise or enjoyment olf any right or privilege secured to
him by the Gonstitution or laws of the United S,atesS, or
because of his having so exercised the same. . . they snall
be fined not more than $5000 or imprisoned not more than 10

years, or both". There are three obvious limitations to the

lie
application of this Act: (1) In the first place since it is

a conspiracy svatute it cannot be violated by a singie person
acting alone. (2) Tne intended object of the conspiracy

must be a citizen of the United States. (3) The purpose

of the consoiracy must be an invasion of rights or orivileges
secured by the Constitution or lews of the United States.
BALDWIN V. FRANKS, 120 U. S. 07%. This statute was before

the Court in the case of U.S. V. WILLIAMS, 341 U. S. 70, which
was deciced in 1951. In tnat case a Florida corporation employed
a detective agency to investigate thefts of its property. Tne
inquiry was conducted by the neaa of tne agency, two employees
of the agency, and a member of tne poiice Yorce of the city

of Miami, florida. Some suspects were pickec up but not
arrested by these people and were forced to confess to the

crime by blows, kicks, threats, and other "third degree"
methnodse Wiiliams, the nead of the detective agency, and

the cther three persons involved were indicted for viclating
this conspiracy statute. They were convicted in tne District
Court but this conviction was reversed by the Court of Avpeals
and the case came to the United States Supreme Court on
certiorari. The Supreme Court held that the conviction was
properly reversed by the Court of Avpeals. ne reasoning of
the majority opinion was that this statute applies only to
interference with rights which arise from the relation of a
person to tne federal government and not to interference by
state officials witn rights which the federal government
Suarantees from abridgment by the statute. The majority
furtner reasoned that the rignt to be immune from a forcec
contession is not a right which arises from the relationship
between the federal government and a private person but is
Simply one against the abridgment of which by the states the
federal government furnishes protection and that therefore the

S.
action for conspiracy would not lie. Just what tnese rights
are which exist because of the relationsnip between a person
and the federal sovernment is not too clear dut in the case

of POWE V. U.S., 109 Fed. 24, 147 (1940), Cert. Den. 309

a)

U.S. 679 (1940) they were defined as including the fotiowing:
(1) The right to assemble peaceably for the purpose of
petitioning the federal government for redress of grievances.
(2) The freedom of speaking and printing on subjects relating
to the federal government, federal elections, federal laws,
tederal operations and officers. (3) Protection of persons
"rom violence wnile in federal custody. (4) Protection of

federal elections by Congress.

CIVIL

5
H’S MATTERS.

PROBRAGL STATUTHS PROVIDING: OR
ACTIONS IN CIVIL HIG

The statutes to be considered in this connection are
4 U.S.C.A., Sections hl, 43 and L7(3). Hereafter, I will
Simply refer to these statutes by the appropriate section
number. Section lil provides as follows: "Ali persons
within the jurisdiction of tne United States shall have tne
Same right in every state ana territory to make and eniorce
contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to tne full
and equal benefit of all laws and proceedinzs for tne security
of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and
snall be subject to like punisnment, fines, penalties, taxes,
licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no ovher". This
section carries with it no Sanctions, civil or criminal. It
is a general statement of constitutional policy which, as
was stated in STHAUDER V. VIRGINIA, 100 U.S. 303, merely
puts in tne form of a statute suostantially what had been
provided by the Fourteenth Amendment. That is, this statute
simply provides a partial enumeration of rishts and immunities

intended to be guaranteed by tne Constitution.
Section h3 provides: "Every person who, under color

hh

of any statute, ordinance, regulation, cuStom, or usage,

Ib

of any State or territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected,

any citizen of the United States or other person within the

a

‘urisdiction to the deprivation of any rignts, privileges, or

Je

Nee

immunities secured by the Constitution ana laws, snail be
liable to the parties injured in an action at law, issued

in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress". This
section was considered by the Supreme Court in 1944 in the

case of SACWDEN V. HUGHES, 3ce1 U.- S- 1l.- In that case, tne
Supreme Court decided that suit under this statute would

lie only where there was a deprivation of rignts, privileges

or imrunitiesS which are incident to citizenship of the United
States, that is rights which a person has because of nis
relationship to the federal government. This section is not
available for redress of a violation of rights which are

simply protected by the Constitution of the United States

trom deprivation by the states. The precise holcing of the
Snowden case was tnat the right to become a candidate for state
office, like the right to vote for tne election of state officers,
is a right or privilege of state citizenship and not one of

national citi

iN]

ensnip. Hence, no action would lie under this
section for the abridgment of this right or privilege.
Section 47 (3) provides: "If two or more persons in

any state or territory conspire to go in di:

(8)

suilse on tne hignway
or on the oremises of another, for the ourpose of depriving
directly or indirectly, any werson or class or persons of the
equal protection of tne laws, or equal priviieges and immunities
under the laws; or for the purpose of preventing or hindering
tne constituted autnorities of any state or territory from

[e
tiving or securing to ail persons witnin such state or
cerritory the equal protection of me laws; .. .-. in any
case of conspiracy set fortn in tnis section, do, or cause

te be done, any act in furtnerance of tne object ofr such

t~ °

consolracy, whereby anotnser is injures in his person or

property, or deprives or having and exercising any right or
orivilege of a citizen of the United States, the party so

urea or deorived may have an action Tor therecovery of
mases, occasioned by such injuries or deprivations, against
any one or more of tne conspirators . The constitutionality
of tnis section is doubtful. tn tne case of U.S. V. HARRIS,
LOb U.S. 0629, (1882) the Sunreme Court had before it for
consideration and indictment unaer a statute wnich was
suostantiaily identicai to Section u47\3) except that that
statute provided a criminal instead of a civil sanction. In
that case, tne Supreme Court held that statute unconstitutional
on the theory tnat tne statute was broaaer tnaan eltner tne
Thirteenth or Fourteentn Amendments and nence beyond tne
autnority of Congress to enacte doowever, this section was
relied on in the case of O'SULLIVAN V. FELIX, 233 U. S. 3138
(L9LL) Whiecn invoived the right to vote.- Furtnermore, this
section was before a court of appeals in 1943 in the case of
did
VILES V. SYMPS, 129 Fed. 2a 828, and that Court/mautd not
question the constitutionality of this section. However, tne
Sulit which was before tne court in that case was dismissed.
There nave been some cases in which certain zovernmental
officials nave been held immune from suit under the civil
risnts acts. PRANDHOVE V. TENNEY, 341 U. S. 376, neld that a
legislator was immune t'rom suit under the Civil Nights Act
for action taken by him in his official capacity even where
shat action was taken in bad faith. Cases involving juages
Thich have reached a similar conclusion are SOUTHER V. REID,
LOL Fled. Suop. $06 (1951) and U.S. V. CRAPLIN, bu Fed. supp.

u26 (19ul). Hdowever, in the case of McSYANE ve. MOLDOVAN,

. 2d, 101d (199) it was held that imnunity from suit

was not available to tne judge.

CONCLUSION

LL

ens o 9 criminal

je
CD

CA

ne feeling tnat at the ore m

Sewer’ ae

ot

l nave
action for violation of civil rights would not lie against
a school official who excludes a Negro from a white school.

My conclusion is based upon this reasoning: In ‘tne opinion

try

just handed down in PROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION IN TOPEKA
COUNTY and the three cases consolidated with that case tne
Supreme Court stated that the cases would be held open for
re-argument next Hall on questions bh and & which it propounded
to counsel betore the decision was nandec. €own. Those
questions relate to the time wnen and the manner in which

this decision is to be implemented. Question 1 in varticular
raises tne question for argument of whether Negro students

Snoulad be admitted immediately to white scnools or whetner

€

ct

his should be done over a period of time. Question 5 is
allied to this same issue. AS we noted, in the Screws case
tne Supreme Court of the United States neld that a criminal
conviction could be had only upon instructions to the jury

and a finding by tne jury that the defendant in sucn a case
has not only a generally bad purpose underlying his action

but also was motivated by a specific intent to deprive a
person of a federal right made definite by a decision or other

rule of law. It seems to me that the recent Supreme Court

9.
segregation decisions fairly clearly imply that Negroes nave
no oresent right to be admitted to wnite schools. Certainly
chere is considerable doubt whether tney nave such a cresent
right and 1 reel tnat if a school official excluded a Negre
from a white school and had an indictment brougnt against him

under tne criminal statute ne could nave the court instruct

js

the jury that this implication and ambiguity in the opinion
in the sesregation cases is a circumstance which they should
consider in passing upon whether that scnool official had a
specific intent to deprive that Negro person of a Yederal
right.

I am of tne opinion tnat it a schooi official were to
now exclude a Negro from a white school tnat ne would not be
liable for suit uncer civil rignts acts. As we noted in the
discussion of these civil acts, such an act does not lie unless
there is a deprivation of rights, privileges or immunities
incident to United States citizenship as distinguisned from
state citizenship. And, we further pointed out that the Supreme
Court has held that the right to become a candidate for a state
office and tne right to vote for the election of state officials
is a right or privilege of state citizensnip and not one of
national citizenship. In the case of US V RUNTIN, 10 Fed. 730
(1802) a tederal judge in charging a jury in a civil rights
case took this view. There is no decision in tnat case upon
which we can rely because that reported case deals solely with
the instruction of a judge to a jury and tne ultimate result
was that the jury disagreed. Education, being a matter of local
concern, would seem to me to fall in the same general category.
Furthermore, I think that here, as in the criminal cases,

there 18 some doubt whether the Negro has a present risgnt to

ve admitted to white schools.
