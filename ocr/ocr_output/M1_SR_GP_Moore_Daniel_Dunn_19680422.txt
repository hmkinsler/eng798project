Governor, in supporting policies of the Good Neighbor Council, has
emphasized that equal employment opportunities must be available in

State Government as well as private industry. He has discussed this

policy with various State officials and has sent supporting memorandum

on several occasions. This effort has been successful and more Negroes --
but not enough -- are employed in meaningful State positions.

I have forwarded this information to you with the hope
that you will urge high school graduates and college graduates to consider
a career in State Government. Additional information as to positions
available can be obtained from the State Personnel Department here in
Raleigh.

With best wishes, I am

Sincerely,

Charles Dunn
Assistant to the Governor
