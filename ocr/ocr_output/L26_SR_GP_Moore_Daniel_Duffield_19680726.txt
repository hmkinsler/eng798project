Dear Governor Moore:

Enclosed is a statement on racial and religious
discrimination approved by the Faculty Senate of North
Carolina State University at its regular meeting of
April 23, 1968. At its regular meeting on May 7, 1968,
the Senate voted that a copy of this statement be for-
warded to the Board of Trustees of the University.

I believe that the relevance and purpose of this
statement are explained in the introductory section.

Sincerely,

. W. Duffveld
Chairman, Faculty Senate

A Statement by the Faculty Senate
of

North Carolina State University on Racial and Religious Discrimination

Introduction. The Faculty Senate of North Carolina State University, in its
Resolution of 9 April 1968, expressed the gravest concern at the unsolved
economic and social problems which are an important cause of much of the
civil disorder afflicting our country. The Resolution of 9 April 1968 called
for action by national and state governments, but recognized that,
"Governmental action alone will not suffice to solve the economic and social
problems which are among the prime causes of such violence."

Substantial progress against the racial and religious discrimination
which is an important factor in many of the economic and social problems of
minority groups depends less upon governmental action than upon individual
personal commitment, expressed both in attitude and action. The Faculty
Senate endorses the following statement because we find discrimination based
on race or religion abhorrent and incompatible with the idea of a university.

We invite all members of the administration, faculty, staff, and student
body, of this University to subscribe to the following statement of position;
more fundamentally, we call upon every individual member of this University
community to accept personal responsibility for making his own contribution
in his own way to the kind of free and open society we must have in America
if our historic ideals are to remain viable. This statement will have served
its purpose if it provides a framework within which each individual may guide
his own action.

Organizations. While most professional organizations are not segregated,
certain fraternal organizations, civic, service, and social clubs to which
faculty, students, and staff belong are still segregated on the basis of race
or religion. We urge each individual to search his own conscience to determine
how he can most effectively work to eliminate discrimination within his own
clubs or organizations. We believe that under no circumstances should any
University function be held in any facility that denies membership or service
on the basis of race, nationality, or religion.

Housing. We note with approval that University housing is unsegregated.
Segregation persists, however, in off-campus housing. We support and promote
open-occupancy practice in Raleigh. Open housing is vital to the well-being
of a university that serves and is served by persons of all races, religions,
and nationalities.

Employment. This University still employs few members of minority groups,
particularly Negroes, in non-traditional positions. Every member of the

University community has a responsibility to do his part to insure that faculty

and staff are employed on the basis of individual qualification, without
regard to race, nationality, or religion.

Recruitment of Students. We ask all who are responsible for recruiting and

admitting students to give full and equal consideration to qualified applicants
from minority groups. We ask, further, that special care be taken to publicize
the fact that this University welcomes qualified students from minority groups.

University Extension. We commend the Agricultural Extension Service, particularly
the 4-H Club activity, which has long offered professional employment to

negroes, and is abolishing racial distinctions in its internal organization.

This Universi ty has done and is doing much to improve the educational and

economic well-being of minority groups in this state. Extension activities

are of such significance in the improvement of the lives of disadvantaged

persons that we emphasize our belief that University Extension, including
Industrial Extension and the Division of Continuing Education, as well as the
Agricultural Extension Service, must continue to play a major role.
