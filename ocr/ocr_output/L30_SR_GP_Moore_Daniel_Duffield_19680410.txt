A RESOLUTION by the Faculty Senate
of

North Carolina State University

The Faculty Senate of North Carolina State University recoil in shock
and sorrow from the violence which has most recently resulted in the death
of the Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Junior, and in civil disorders
on a scale not previously seen in this country in our lifetimes. Govern-
mental action alone will not suffice to solve the economic and social prib-
lems which are among the prime causes of such violence, but the problems
must be solved and we see in prompt and comprehensive governmental action
a powerful force toward solution. With the National Advisory Commission
on Civil Disorders, we believe that, "Only a commitment to national action
on an unprecedented scale can shape a future compatible with the historic

ideals of American society."

We therefore urge, most respectfully, by copy of this resolution, the
President of the United States, the North Carolina delegation in the United
States Senate and the House of Representatives, the Governor of North Caro-
lina, and the North Carolina General Assembly, by giving their executive
and legislative support, and by using their public and private influence,
jointly and severally, to insure prompt enactment of such legislation as mav
be necessary to effect an early amelioration and continued progress toward
an eventual solution of the economic and social problems of the disadvantaged

groups among us.
