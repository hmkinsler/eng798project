‘T’MeNO ADMIRER’

| Byrd: King Victim
Of Own Violence

Ed

~ shocked but I

W A SHINGTON—(UPI)
The man who would be Jeader
of the Senate of the United
States rose in the chamber
Friday to describe Martin Lu-
ther King Jr. as a victim of his
own violence.

A quiet
hushed as Sen. Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va., said, “I am no ad-
mirer of Dr. King. What I am
saying is difficult to say and it
may not be considered entirely
in keeping with the views being
expressed by many.”

Byrd, No. 3 man in the
Democratic leadership, hopes
one day to perhaps succeed
Sen. Mike Mansfield, D-Mont.
He is now secretary of the
Democratic conference and as-
sistant whip.

Mansfield, covering his
eyes with one hand, sat next
to Byrd as he spoke.

Byrd, critical of King's activ-
ities in Memphis in recent
speeches, said he regretted the
assassination as much as any
man in Congress. “I was

Sen. Robert Byrd
... No. 3 In Senate

learned from events in Mem-
phis: Mass protests, mass
demonstrations and mass
marches—labeled non-violent or
otherwise—can only serve to
cause unrest and disorder and
to provoke violence and blood-
shed.

“And in the ena, those who
advocate such methods often

.. themselves become the victims

of the forces they have set in
motion. This is what happened

- to Dr. King.

“He usually spoke of non-
violence. Yet violence, alj too
- often, resulted from his ac-
and at the last he
himself met a violent end.”

Byrd noted King’s opposition
to a court injunction blocking a
planned Memphis demonstra-
tion Monday and quoted King
as saying, ‘‘We're not going to
let any injunction turn us

” around.”

“One cannot preach non-vio-
lence and advocate defiance of
the law,”’ Byrd said. He went
-on to quote the Bible on defying
the law. He used to teach the

- Robert C. Byrd Bible class

back in Crab Orchard, W.Va.,
where he was once a butcher
and a member of the Ku_Klux
Klan.

“Dr. King’s profession was
that of a minister. But no man
is required to be a member of
the clergy to be able to read
and to understand these simple
Passages from the scriptures.”

A few days ago Byrd urged
the federal government to seek
an injunction to block King’s
planned ‘‘Poor People’s
March” on Washington.: - ,

Dear Miss Hilton:

Thank you for sending me a cepy of your letter to
Senator Robert C. Byrd with regard to the outbreaks of violence
which followed the death of Dr. Martin Luther King.

I appreciate having yout views, and assure you that
State Government will remain ready to assist local authorities,
as necessary, in suppressing violence in North Carolina.

My best wishes to you for all happiness in your forth-
coming marriage.

Sincerely,

Dan Moore
