Dear Governor Unstesds

I was horrified at the ruling of non-segregation which the Supreme
Court has ordered. To me, our States Rights have been taken away
and we are being dictated to. ‘shat next? What else are we going
to be told we can or cannot, do”

I am a taxpayer, as many others are in this state, and when we are
not given the privilege to say whet we can do with the money we

are paying for our own children, I think it is high time the South
took a firm stand! When Negrds can pay their own way, then its

time to see what can be done, But as long as the white people are
paying for them and keeping them up, they have no right to say

what will be done with "our" money’ ‘hat's the matter with our
government? Are we to be dictated to as the Russian people are
having done to them today? We are on the straight road to Communism
with no detours!

I have a two and a half year old boy who will be going to school in
a few years, and I certainly do not want him having tokwith Negros.
I don't think our Supreme Court or Government knows what they are
doing. This thing is going to cause race riots and we are going

to be in a worse situation than we are now, if the South lets this
thing go any further. It's all you can do to get a Negro to work
and most of the time you can't get one to work at all! Why should
I, and the rest of us, pay for people who want something for nothing
and are not even willing to help themselves? I am willing to pay
my part for separate schools, as we have done in the past, but until
the Negro race is willing to accept full responsibility for citizen-
ship, then they shouhd be grateful for what they are getting. It is
an outrage that we have to support them and then heave to enter our
children in private schools--Waring this additional expense. You
may be sure that my children will never go to school with them and

I shall do everything in my power to keep it from becoming an
established fact.

Mr. Umstead, I hove that you will stand firm against this thing,
because I fear for our children if this situation persists.

Very truly yours,
