The Honorable Dan K. Moore
Governor of North Carolina
Raleigh, North Carolina

Dear Governor Moore:

I respectfully request that you use the powers of your office to assist in
establishing effective channels of communication between the city government
and the people of Durham. It is my feeling that the two groups have reached an
impasse,

The events of Thursday, February 15, 1968, in the City of Durham pointed
up the tensions which lie just beneath the surface of the city. It is tension which
has built up to explosive proportions and broke out in destructive disorder. These
tensions still exist, potientially more explosive than before.

A number of people have made statements in response to this event emphazing
the need to maintain law and order and the determination to control any similar
outbreaks in the future. However, none of these people addressed themselves to the
real causes of the disorder, those things which produce and maintain the tension.
Durham is still ripe for disorders because the tension is still here. It needs only
a spark to light the fire. Durham is typical of the cities where riots occured last
summer. Each of these; Watts, Newark, and Detroit, according to the chairman
of the President's Study Commission on Riots, was triggered by events involving the
police. So also was the event in Durham last Thursday.

In none of these cities has there been decisive action by the city government
which would ease the tension. Neither has there been any action to ease the tension
in Durham. All these cities are as ripe for riots today as they were last summer.

Will they be set off again? Will Durham's tensions be triggered again?

My hope is that this will not happen. But this hope can only be realized
through decisive action--words will not suffice. Decisive action must be taken to
reduce and eliminate the tensions which exist. The answer is not in increased and
more efficient methods of riot control. Controls such as this do nothing to prevent
outbreaks but are only effective in putting down disturbances. The threat of punish-
ment will not stop disorders from breaking out. More people may be jailed or killed
in a shorter period of time using these methods but the tensions within the city will
continue to rise.

The anwer lies in attacking the root causes of the tensions. Of course, these
cannot be overcome quickly but will possibly take years of patient effort. A beginning
can be made, however, which will greatly reduce the tension. This beginning is to
establish truly meaningful communications between the city government and the people
of the city.

Once again I ask for your assistance.

Respectfully yours,
