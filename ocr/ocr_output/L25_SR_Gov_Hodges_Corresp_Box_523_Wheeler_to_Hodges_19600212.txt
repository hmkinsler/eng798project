Dear Sir:

At last night's meeting of the Durham Committee on Negro Affairs,
the body adopted unanimously, the attached statement with
reference to the 'sit-down' demonstrations conducted in variety
stores throughout North Carolina by Negro students.

The Committee also instructed me as its Chairman to transmit
to the Daily Press, various state officials and presidents of
Negro Colleges, the full text of this statement.

Sincerely yours,

Although the Durham Committee on Negro Affairs was unaware officially
or unofficially, of plans on the part of North Carolina College students to
stage a ‘sit-down' protest against discriminatory practices at the lunch
counters in Woolworth and Kress Stores, certain facets of this matter have
caused the Committee to take the position that it is entirely appropriate for it
to make a statement in support of the aderly and dignified manner in which
these students have sought to make our state and nation fully aware of a
pattern of discrimination which hinders the development of wholesome relations
between the various racial groups which compose the American citizenry.

The appropriateness of this statement is heightened by the fact
that portions of the daily press, certain public officials and other highly
placed persons within the state have called upon the responsible Negro leader-
ship (including college presidents) to use its influence to halt activities
of Negro students and their white counterparts who have joined the movement.
It is our opinion, that instead of expressing disapproval, we have an obliga-
tion to support any peaceful movement which seeks to remove from the customs
of our beloved southland, those unfair practices based upon race and color
which have for so long a time been recognized as a stigma on our way of life
and a stumbling block to moral and economic progress of the region.

Approximately two years ago, the Durham Committee on Negro Affairs
conducted a survey of the 5¢ and 10¢ stores located in Durham. This survey
indicated that between fifty and sixty per cent of the persons entering the
Kress, Silvers and Woolworth stores, were colored people. Obviously, the
students' protest is against a system which solicits and accepts the trade
of Negro patrons while denying them employment opportunities and the use of
dining facilities which are usually offered for the exclusive convenience of

white and foreign patrons. This protest appears to recognize that although
ee

many thoughtful Southerners believe such practices to be morally wrong and
economically unsound, the South as a whole, has not achieved sufficient maturity
to move voluntarily toward eradicating such injustices as long as any vocal
segment of the white population expresses its opposition. This protest also
recognizes the historic failure and frustration of numerous efforts by Negro
groups to negotiate changes in the present pattern through persuasion and
conference, This view is adequately supported by a review of the important
advances which have been made in the field of civil rights, almost all of
which have occurred against the backdrop of litigation and mass protest.

Unfortunately, or fortunately, Negro students throughout our land
have been taught in both public and private schools that they hold a citizen-
ship status which is equal in all respects to that of every other American.
It is commendable that in the face of obvious attempts to indoctrinate them to
the contrary, they now emerge as a vital and strong group of stalwart citizens
whose image of themselves is such that they are determined to accept no longer,
the inferior status which the South still seeks to thrust upon them.

The Negro citizens of our community hope for successful negotiations
between student leaders and representatives of the various stores affected.
We are also hopeful that these negotiations will lead to formation of fair
employment practices and an enlightened policy providing for a cordial invita-
tion to all patrons to use the dining facilities without being segregated
according to race. It is reasonable to expect that the giant corporations of
our country will find themselves in position to furnish leadership in matters
of this kind. In like manner, it is reasonable to expect that our State
Officials will recognize their responsiblity for having North Carolina live
up to its reputation of being the enlightened, liberal and progressive state
which our industry-hunters have been representing it to be. Indeed, it is

urgently necessary that we shall prove ourselves to be, in fact, what we have
been saying we are when talking to those corporations which we have invited

to establish new factories within our borders on grounds that there is in
North Carolina a climate of racial tolerance and understanding which will
enable personnel coming from other sections of the country to live in an
atmosphere consistent with the American ideals of freedom and equality for all
persons.

In conclusion, we commend these students for the dignified manner
in which they have demonstrated the kind of poise and maturity which have
enabled them to smile while being cursed, showered with eggs, and threatened
with physical violence by irresponsible elements of our various North
Carolina communities who would do well to acquire some of the qualities of

good citizenship and understanding which have been shown by those who protest.
