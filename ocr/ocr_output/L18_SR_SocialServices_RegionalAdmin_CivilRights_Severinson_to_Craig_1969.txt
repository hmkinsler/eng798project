OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS

JUL 25 1969

Colonel Clifton M. Craig
Commissioner

State Department of Social Services
P.O. Box 2599

Raleigh, North Carolina 27602

Dear Colonel Craig:

This is the final report oan the resulte of the Title VI Review of
the North Carolina State Department of Social Services conducted
December 2-18, 1968, by Ragional Social and Rehabilitation Service,
Public Health Service and Office for Civil Rights staff, and
discussed with you and your staff on May 19, 1969.

The cooperation and support given by you and your staff in the
preparation for the review, in carrying it forward, and in
looking ahead to the next steps to be taken toward achievement

of full compliance are very mich appreciated. While the findings
and recommendations of the review tend to emphasize areas in

need of attention, it is obvious that you and your staff have
been serving the minority group constituency well in many ways.
We are confident that you will be able to make the changes and
develop the procedures which will yield equal opportunity for all
persons served by agencies under your direction.

As a means of assisting you in carrying out your overall Title VI
responsibilities, we have assigned two staff members, Mr. Thomas F.
Beddow and Mrs. Billie Glover, to work directly with you and

other North Carolina State Health and Social Services agencies.

They will be available to you and your staff to provide technical
assistance and consultation, as well as to assist you in maintaining
a continuing evaluation of the compliance aspects of yowr program.
These services will, of course, be offered in close coordination
with the Regional Office of Social and Rehabilitation Service.
Colonel Clifton M. Craig

The findings of the North Carolina State Agency Review, as related

to the State Department of Social Services, are as follow:

i.

The State Agency in its State Plan Transmittal #1,
dated March 2, 1965, identified three areas of
noncompliance with Title VI; (1) ‘The assignment
of Negro supervisory specialists to nursing homes
and homes for the aged which are operated by and
patronized by Negroes only; (2) Caseload
assignments in child welfare made solely on the
basis of race and day care purchased from facilities
which are segregated and serve only one race;

(3) Twenty-four counties employed Negro case-
workers and assigned these workers only to Negro
caseloads, The State Agency responded by telegram
on July 22, 1965, with reference to these three
exceptions that on the basis of compliance
statements signed by county directors the State
Agency knows "of no areas of noncompliance at
county welfare level." Nevertheless in Wake County
and New Hanover County it was stated during the
review that desegregation of caseloads actually
occurred during Cetober 1968, and this has not yet
been wholly accomplished since there are still
workers whe carry either one-race caseloads, or
caseloads with only one or two white clients with
the rest Negroes. In Pitt County, the two Negro
homemakers have had six Negro and no white cases,
nine Negro and one white case respectively. The
state Agency lacks a procedure for assuring itself
that the areas of noncompliance which existed in
1965 have been corrected. It is also clear that
compliance statements do not suffice.

The State Agency has relied on compliance statements
from hospitals, child-caring institutions,

maternity homes, facilities for the mentally retarded,

and boarding schools as a means of determining
compliance. There has been no provision for on-site
roviews.

County welfare departnents have been delegated
responsibility by the State Agency for securing
compliance from homes for the aged, nursing homes,
and facilities from which day care is purchased.
The State Agency has compiled lists of such
facilities reported to be in compliance, but there

has been no provision for on-site reviews, and no
method for the State Agency to assure itself that
all facilities used by the county departments are,
in fact, in compliance.

A civil rights review of local departments was
conducted in July 1968. A questionnaire was used
as the basis for evaluating the compliance of
local departments with Title VI. Neither the
review process nor the questionnaire provided
adequate means of evaluating the compliance status
of local departments, and the procedure, as well
as the responsibility for evaluating the local
departments, was informal. The review and the
questiomaire did not provide a means of
evaluating caseload assignments ) of analyzing the
handling of cases or the comparing of processing
time for Negro, white and Indian cases, or
comparing the quality of case handling for white
and minority clients.

The State Agency offers training to State Agency
staff, county staff, ete., with Title VI
approached as "a codification of the Agency's
philosophy regarding the dignity of the individual,"
Responses of staff mambers in direct service
interviews show that this has not been sufficient
to provide information on what Title VI requires

in order to achieve a delivery of agency services
without discrimination on the basis of race, color,
or national origin. Many staff members are
unfamiliar with the content of the State Agency's
civil rights releases and forms. Most workers

do not know that they have responsibility for
observing and reporting instances of discrimination
in the treatment of clients in vendor facilities.
Few staff members recall having been instructed

in the procedures for complaint handling. Many

do not know that both the State Agency and the
Federal Government provide avenues for handling
complaints.

Some county agency staff members do not understand
the proper procedure by which a client may make, or
be assisted in making a Title VI complaint, as
distinguished from an appeal.

somes county agency staff members report that there

are continuing problems in the use of courtesy titles.
Colomel Clifton M. Craig

o.

LO.

Although meetings have been held to remind staff
members of the importance of using courtesy titles,
and a special effort is made to use courtesy
titles for a period of time, the staff members
gradually drop the courtesy titles again.

In case reading in all four counties reviewed it
was found that specifically for AFDC but also for
most other categories the time required to process
woite cases from application to first payment is
significantly lesa than the time required to
precess Negro cases.

Wake AFDC white-20 days Negro-60s days
Lincoln AFDC white-33 days Negro-55 days
New Hanover AFDC white-28 days Negro~38 daye
Pitt AFDC white-25 days Negro-l)3 days

In case reading in ali four counties reviewed it
was found that the quality of case handling is
less adequate for the Negro cases than for the
wiite cases as judged by the proportion of cases
in which readers noted either deviation from
standards or examples of handling adverse to the

Proportion of Cases with Adverse Handling:

Wake white 0@ Negro 27.7%
Lincoln white 8.3% Negro 50.0%
New Hanover white 12.3% Negro 3.3%
Pitt white 17.6% Negro 32.2%

As a general observation from interviews with
county agency staff members, the Negro workers
are less satisfied than the white workers with
the effectiveness of Title VI compliance efforts
with applicants, clients, vendors, and staff.
The small number of Negro workers employed and
feelings about chances for promotions are
mentioned.

In Wake County Welfare Department, the one Negro
clerical worker employed since 1960 is not asked

to serve as receptionist whereas all white clerical
workers take their turn at receptionist duty.

In Pitt County a vendor, the Bethel Clinic, was
found to have separate entrances and separate
waiting rooms used on a segregated basis.
Colonel Clifton M. Graig

12.

In Lincoln County a complaint was made in regard to
Gordon Crewell Memorial Hospital that all Negro
patients are placed in the hall and in one wing.

A review of records for the month of November, and
a l5eday census tended to confirm the substance of
this complaint.

Negro children are being sent only to the Central
Orphanage of North Carolina, while white children
are utilizing all existing institutions within
the State with the exception cof the Central

Orphanage of North Carolina.

Four nursing or rest homes were visited: One, an
ECF, was well integrated. A second, not an ECF,
had 15 Negro and 27 white patients but no biracial
occupancy at amy time, and no public notice of an
open policy; a third had 11 white welfare

patients and no Negro patients; the fourth, a

rest hore, had 3] Negro patients, 29 of them on

mmendations evolved fron these findings, and in conference
with you and your staff on May 27, 1969, agreements were reached.

i.

Recommanda tt ons Necesse Ax

Be

The North Carolina Department of Social Services
should take steps to assure itself and the Office
for Civil Rights that all future referrals and
acceptances of children to child-caring institutions
are made without regard to race, color or national
origin.

The North Carolina Department of Secial Services
should take steps to assure itself and the Office
for Civil Rights that all local departments of
public welfare reevaluate the placement of all
children for whom they have legal custody who are
presently being cared for in Central State Orphanage
at Oxford, North Carolina. If a child is presently
at that institution because of the child's race,
then that child should now be referred to and placed
in the institution in which he or she would have
been placed had he or she not been a Negro.

Recommendations for a Effective Comp

che

The State Agency should review and correct the
examples of noncompliance observed at Bethel
Clinic in Pitt County which has separate entrances
and waiting rooms used on a segregated basis; at
Gorden Crowell Hospital in Lincoln County where a
complaint was received that Negro patients are
placed in the hall and in one wing and at the
Wake County Department of Public Welfare where a
Negro typist is not assigned to receptionist duty
as white typists are.

The State Agency should develop a procedure for the

periodic review of Title VI compliance of county
departments, including study of comparative
processing time for white and Negro applicants,
comparative analysis of quality of case handling for
white, Negro, and Indian clients, and analysis of
case assignments for white and Negro staff members.
The State Agency should seek ways to utilize its
data processing capability to monitor the delivery
of services to clients to determine that there are
no inequities based on considerations of race. The
procedures should include written reports available
for periodic review by Regional Office for Civil
Rights and Regional Social and Rehabilitation ‘«:-‘re
representatives.

The State Agency should develop a procedure, with
assigned staff responsibility for periodic on-site
reviews on Title VI to assure the continuing
compliance of hospitals, child-caring institutions,
maternity homes, boarding schools, as well as
facilities from which day care is purchased. This
may be done by the State Agency or by contractual
arrangement with other State Agencies. The State
Agency in either case retains compliance responsi-
bility and the results of such periodic on-site
reviews should be available for review by Regional
Office for Civil Rights staff and Regional Social
and Rehabilitation Service representatives.

AGREEMENT; ‘The State Agency, within 60 days, veol’

submit plans to accomplish the foregoing recommendations.

Employment of a full-time Civil Rights Coordinator
whose duties would include:
Colonel Clifton M. Craig

Ce

1. Maintaining reguiar contact with all componente
of the Department of Social Services to assist
management in these components with respect to
all Title VI functions and responsibilities.

2. Developing methods for maintaining continued
compliance for staff, vendors, and other
agencies as appropriate.

3. Developing written material concerning Title VI
to be distributed to staff, clients, news media,
and others as appropriate.

h, Maintaining liaison with his comterpart or
counterparts in other State agencies, city and
county agencies, other organizations, and with
the Office for Civil Rights, Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare, Region III.

It is recommended that the North Carolina Department of
Social Services implement a more effective Equal
Employment Program throughout the Department.

The State Agency should develop a broader program for
Title VI training for new staff and existing staff at
all levels, State and local, to make sure that all
staff members not only understand the provisions of
Title VI, and the procedures for complaint handling,
but also the problems of attitude and working
relationships which have the effect of discrimination
in slower and less adequate case handling for minority
group clients. :

The North Carolina Department of Social Services

should instruct all local departments of public welfare
that, when a client's file indicates the services of

a nursing home or extended care facility are needed, the
caseworker is to assist the client in selecting such
facility and the selection and referral should be made
without regard to race, color, or national origin.

AGREEMENT; The State Agency, within 60 days, would

advise of decisions reached on each of the above

recommendations describing means of implementation
and showing time schedules for accomplishment.
