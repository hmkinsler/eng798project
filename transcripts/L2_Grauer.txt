Let us be fair! Let us give ALL Americans an equal opportunity. Let us all work together to provide decent housing, have open housing and do everything within our power to foster respect and dignity for ALL Americans regardless of their color.

On the other hand, violence on the part of anyone should NOT be tolerated, but hollow calls for law and order from the white community while they are doing relatively nothing to change the horrible plight of the Negro American are stupid and border on the criminal. Let us, in North Carolina, enforce the laws fairly but work to educate and change the plight, particularly of the children, born into a life in which they are doomed to poverty and ignorance.

Thank you, Governor Moore, for anything and everything you are attempting to do, Let us know if we can be of help in any way.

Two WHITE-PROPERTY-Owning Americans who are concerned.
