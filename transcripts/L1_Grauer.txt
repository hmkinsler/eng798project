This is to inform you that two white North Carolina voters are in favor
of passage of all legislation which will guarantee the rights of Negro
Americans. In particular we are in favor of the pending civil rights law,
in the House of Representatives, with its open housing provision.

It is imperative that you and all in authority act as quickly as possible
to end the injustice to the American Negro.

Violence on the part of anyone should not be tolerated; but hollow calls
for law and order, from the white community while nothing is being done to
change the horrible plight of Negro Americans, are stupid and border on the
criminal.

All those who believe in and love America must now come forward and see to
it that injustices against Negro Americans and all others are stopped.

With hope in the American
dream,
