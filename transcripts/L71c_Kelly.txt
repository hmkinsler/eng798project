I wish to protest the outrageous treatment accorded to Negro students in the Hyde County Courthouse as reported in the enclosed account of some in the N.Y. Times. 

I could not help being reminded of the Nazis herding people into rooms to be gassed. When police, however, severely they are harassed, resort to this type of treatment they only influence, outrage and further diminished respect for proper authority. 

Kindly put a stop to the barbarity. 

Yours truly,
