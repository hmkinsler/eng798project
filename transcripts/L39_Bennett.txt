I would like to bring to your personal attention a plan that might possibly prevent, in the future, much of the rioting and looting to which our people have been subjected recently. To inclement this plan, if merit is seen in it, no doubt will require action by your office, and possibly on a federal level. Therefore, I hope you may see fit to give it serious thought. 

Let notices be enclosed with welfare checks and unemployment benefit checks advising that if recipient is apprehended while engaging in a riot or insurrection that it may be reason to deny future benefits. And, in the case of dependent children of welfare families so apprehended, let these families be put on notice that failure by parent or guardian to restrain their children from engaging in such attacks against the very society furnishing them a livelihood, may be reason to suspend future benefits. 

The state now is empowered to suspend or revoke a driver's license if the person holding such a license endangers the lives and property of other citizens on our highways, even though the loss of this license may mean loss of a job. And, in certain cases, rioting and looting can mean loss of citizenship upon conviction. So, unless a welfare check is now sacrosanct, or has become more precious than citizenship, I am of the opinion that families dependent upon our society for a livelihood would cease their attacks, if given such an economic incentive to do so. 

Since the only alternative seems to be by force of arms, I hope you see merit in my suggestion and can devise a means to implement it. Thank you for your consideration. 

Respectfully
