The recant slaying of Dr, Martin Luther King has precipitated considerable concern and discussion among the members of the bi-racial Scotland County Ministers' Fellowship.

Determined to dispense with fruitless rhetoric and to generate responsible and constructive action, the ministers, in a series of study sessions, have hammered out concrete recommendations for social progress, some of which we submit to you in the enclosed Resolution.

We urge your serious consideration to this enclosure and invite your studied response,

God's blessing to you in your important area of service.

Cordially

We recognize that Governor Dan Moore, in the recent crisis, acted decisively and responsibly and would commend him for his level-headedness in this. We also recognize that his re-appointment of Mr. David S. Coltrane at the beginning of his term of office was one of his more significant acts. We feel however that limiting Mr. Coltrane’ s duties to being "one who puts out fires and cools down ashes" is too limited an approach to the deep-seated racial and economic problems of our day. We feel that the approach has been negative especially in that the advisory committee has been so "blue-ribbon" that it does not really know the needs and the feelings of the group it is supposed to be giving advice about. We would о call upon the governor and all other elected state officials to begin a positive approach to a program which will include a revamping of the objectives of Coltrane’ office; a spreading of the membership of his advisory committee to more adequately reflect end deal with the grass-roots problems of both urban and rural sections of our state and the people; and better liaison with every department of state government that they may join with Coltrane ’s office in pursuing a positive approach to identifying and dealing with the various aspects of the problem. 

We ask that state officials make available regularly through press releases and other suitable means the current data on employment in the various departments of state government and the national guard; and that this be done by categories, i.e., professional, sub-professional, non-professional, clerical, etc., and that the number of non-white in each category of each department be clearly shown. We also ask that each department of state government make available on the same basis information on the policies and programs it has by which it’s employees may continue to upgrade their skills and proficiency in order to qualify for promotion. 

We call on our elected representatives to confront seriously the need for a revision of our state constitution and our state statute .laws so that there shall be real ©quality and justice under law for all people in our state. 

We urge all elected and appointive state officials to give highest priority to seeking better methods of dealing with the inequalities of education, housing and job opportunities too many of the people of our state live with every day.
