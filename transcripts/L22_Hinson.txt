I know that you have many things on your mind but as one of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers who is greatly concerned about the diminishing personal freedoms and the rising tide of so-called civil rights demonstrations, I feel that you and your group will and are giving careful and diligent attention and will solve trie race situation if left unhampered by outside agitators. 

As indicated by the attached clipping, I am sure that you realize that a young man, too young to vote, sent here by outside interests to lead a howling group of teenagers serves no purpose except to stir our people up and to further trie interest of communist and. other outside groups who have no interest whatsoever in our state or people. 

Apparently, persons of the caliber of the young man pictured in this clipping are certainly misguided and suffer from an inferiority complex and are pawns of a larger group who apparently have unlimited capital behind them. 

I do not belong to the KKK and neither have I ever indicated a desire to join that organization, but, the МААС! has asked that the state of Forth Carolina revoke the charter of the KKK. I know many people who belong to the KKK who are decent, upright, business and civic leaders and citizens and I feel that the KKK has just as much right if net more in the state of North Carolina than the NAACP. The NAACP has created more discord in the state of North Carolina than the KKK ever has in the history of the world and if the civil rights movement is allowed to continue on its present collision course, it will only serve to drive thousands and thousands of North Carolinians into the ranks of KKK since it is apparent ly the only organization with any semblance of protection from the growing tide of civil liberty withdrawals. 

I thank you for your indulgence in reading this ana in all sincerity and with due respect to any race or religion I feel that any race gaining and enjoying special privileges should deserve them, earn them and strive to protect the tax structure which ultimately must pay the bill for these privileges. 

With kindest regards
