We are most thankful to you for your telegram, April 6, 1968, in which you appealed for Order in the State. We wholly agree that order must be established in the State, and we pledge our support to its establishment. We further pledge to give ourselves unreservedly to the encouragement of the maintenance of Order.

It is well to note that we have used the word ORDER, rather than the phrase â€œlaw and order." We have done this for two specific reasons. (1) The phrase "law and order" is a misnomer in its most honest admission (2) We hold law as a part of Order. It is the latter statement that we shall deal with briefly and appeal to you for your help as Governor of North Carolina and Governor of all the people, black and white.

Law is a part of Order; it is not a part equal with Order such as the phrase "law and order." The administration of law is the basic cause for dis-order, whether this administration is in the enactment of laws, or the injustice in their application. In order that we are understood, let us give an example: We have laws in North Carolina for which the penalty is death for their violation -- the black man
has paid this penalty many times for acts committed against white people in North Carolina, but never has a white man paid the death penalty for the very same acts committed against Negroes even though they have been numerous. The failure here was to apply the law justly. It is this injustice and cruelty which has disturbed order and created disorder.

It is not a lack of respect for law. Most men have high respect for law, but we must be honest with you, they have lost confidence in white man to administer it fairly and rightly. Confidence must be rebuilt, faith must be established, and justice must become a reality blind to the color of one's skin. It is here we appeal to you to help us establish Order. We will continue to work for the good of mankind, uninhibitedly by the color of one's skin. We appeal to you as Governor and other officials to help us to make this State, State of justice, not based on race, but on right. We must be equally as candid with you in closing as we have been 'throughout the letter, if we do not arrive at justice without the color of one's skin, children unborn today will hate tomorrow. 

Most honorably yours
