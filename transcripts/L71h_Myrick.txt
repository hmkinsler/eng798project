As you know, we have recently had same correspondence about Civil Rights matters, but not directly relative to the Swan Quarter, N. C. school situation now claiming widespread attention in Eastern Carolina and Virginia. 

This is of special interest to me, as a former resident of North Carolina. While not a former resident of the Eastern area of the state, I am closer now to the Swan Quartor area than ever before. Right at this very moment Rev. Abernathy, of the Southern Christian movement is there roughing it up and preparing to give all the trouble he can. Of course, if the appropriate office of уour department had left the matter, as it should have been, to the local school officials, there would have been no trouble. But our government oan't stay out of matters where "angels fear to tread." 

When any or all such matters come to my mind, I must always think back to the first and fundamental causes of the troubles in our schools ever since May 17, 1954, when the great justice Warren handed down the most famous Civil Rights decision for the Supreme Court. For him to come in shortly prior to that decision and to have unanimous hacking from the Court in said decision, despite the many differences of opinion throughout the country at the time, was convincing to me that there was a certain minority group back of it all with power to overcome our government and enforce whatever they willed, despite the conscientious feeling of the vast majority of the people. We don’t have to cite what has happened, and is still happening, since. 

While we certainly have the right to criticize, it is better to have greater pity for those, it seems, who conscientiously feel they should mix and forge the two races to the ultimate extinction of either and the amalgamation of both. To those who openly urge integration in our schools, nixing socially and morally ae they must, contending there is no harm to either race, but will not send their own children to nixed schools or mix as they urge others to do, it must be said they are guilty of the rankest deceit. Those accused of bigotry and prejudice, are better, they are just what they are; they don’t wear two faces. 

Your Department should settle the Swan Quarter matter as the good people there feel it ought to be. 

Personally, I long to see the day when we can get back to education again, because It is indisputable that this generation will be the least educated over the past 50 or more years. In my last College teaching experience, before interference in the schools by the Supreme Court and the Federal administration, the education of Freshmen entering College then was bad enough. My observation and what I hoar now convinces ne that the poor kids today can’t write, spell not think straight on most ordinary matters. 

It would have been far better for the Supreme Court to have said the races are equal and stopped there, leaving all matters as to races, schools, opportunities and what have you, to the states to work out on an equal basis, whatever we may think or say, matters could never have been worse . There would have been more and better education, and integration could not have been less. Government interference has created ill feeling, prejudice and a general standoff both as to whites and blacks, that never would have occurred. 

Very truly yours
