This is to acknowledge with appreciation your appeal to the churches of North Carolina as of April 6. 

Now that the crisis is apparently passed at least for the time being, I sincerely hope that North Carolina will move forward to deal with the major issues that underlie the disturbances of the last week. It was needful to call for the dispelling of strife and for an end to violence, but the matter should not end there. We must now move forward on a positive note to constructive action. 

The action of the Mayor of Winston-Salem last night (April 10) is the kind of action that is needed for our entire state. I would appeal to you as the Governor of North Carolina to consider some such action for the state as a whole. 

As a life-long citizen concerned about our state, I would appeal to you to: 

1. Call upon industry in North Carolina to make a common effort now to find jobs for as many of the unemployed as possible, particularly those in poverty areas. 

2. Call upon the municipalities of North Carolina to form urban coalitions such as Mayor Benton is seeking to establish in Winston-Salem. In this way the cities can seek to deal with their local problems in a positive way. 

3. Call upon the entire state to work for the elimination of other social ills such as inadequate housing for the poor. 

4. Call upon the candidates for public office in this election year to conduct campaigns free of racism. I have followed the campaign of the many candidates carefully in these past weeks. There is much in what I have heard so far that gives rise to fear and misgiving and little that encourages hope. 

It is this latter point that disturbs me most. Too often in North Carolina in recent years politicians are rewarded for their negative stand on race. This leads the candidates to vie with one another in their appeal to prejudice and racial ill will. As example the present candidates for Governor are competing to see who can make the strongest statements on riots and violence. None apparently dares speak at all of our need to deal constructively with the crisis that faces us as a state and nation. Adequate law enforcement is vital, but is this all that needs to be said? 

The time for North Carolina to move to prevent riots next summer is in May and June. It would be a great thing for our state if you, as Governor, in an address to the people would call upon all of us to rise above prejudice and ill will and seek good will, understanding and peace. 

Sincerely yours
