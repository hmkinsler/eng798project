I am very disturbed at the recent outbreak in Durham, North Carolina involving the Director of Training for the Foundation Community Development, Howard Fuller.

As you know, after considerable investigation last year, I requested that your office use its influence to have Howard Fuller dismissed from the North Carolina Fund. This request was based on documented facts gathered by the Chief Investigator of the U.S. House Education and Labor Committee, tying Mr. Fuller in with last summer's violent civil rights outbursts in Durham.

It is my opinion that the North Carolina Fund is involved in many practices that are harmful for the State of North Carolina. The activities of an employee of a grantee organization of the North Carolina Fund such as Mr. Fuller inciting people to take law in their own hands is inexcusable and must be stopped.

As a U.S. Congressman and a concerned citizen, I urgently request the Governor's office to begin an immediate investigation into the activities of the North Carolina Fund and its grantee agencies. I am also writing the Director of the North Carolina Fund, Mr. George Esser urging the dismissal of Howard Fuller, an employee of the Foundation for Community Development.

I feel that this is a very serious problem confronting North Carolina, and I would hope that you would use the influence of your office to investigate this organization, particularly to see if certain activities by the North Carolina Fund are in violation of the North Carolina Charter. I am sure that you share my concern that no person or group receiving federal money should be allowed to operate under a tax free shelter and at the same time advocate violence.

Sincerely yours
