In this letter I want to take time to express my opinion regarding the nearsighted and non-specific views given recently by your aid Mr. David Coltrane concerning racial turmoil in North Carolina. 

Do you think that North Carolina has had considerable racial violence in recent months due to the fact that it has relatively more Negro college students than most other southern states; or could it possibly be due to the fact that North Carolina has predominantly more educated Negros than most of southern states, who are more aware of the Articles of Confederation, the Bill of Rights, and last the constitution of the United States?

Yes Mr. Moore, you could say that North Carolina has more Negro college students than most other southern states; and because so, there are less "Uncles called Toms", who due to ignorance, accept things the way they were and are, who are not aware of their rights and don't know how to rebel against the merciless amounts of white racism that has suppressed them for over 400 years. 

I say to you Mr. Moore that laws cannot change the hearts of people (white racists), and until these change, there is going to be more riots, more violence, and more turmoil. But keep in mind one thing: racial riots are not Black Power motives to destroy the white man and what's his, they are part of a revolution just like the American Revolution of 1775, or the French Revolution of 1789, the Russian Revolution, English, Chinese, etc.

Very truly yours
