The Faculty Senate of North Carolina State University wishes to support your efforts in the cause of social and economic justice for all North Carolinians. In token of this support, I enclose a copy of a resolution passed by our Faculty Senate on April 9, 1968. 

Sincerely

A RESOLUTION by the Faculty Senate of North Carolina State University 

The Faculty Senate of North Carolina State University recoil in shock and sorrow from the violence which has most recently resulted in the death of the Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Junior, and in civil disorders on a scale not previously seen in this country in our lifetimes. Governmental action alone will not suffice to solve the economic and social problems which are among the prime causes of such violence, but the problems must be solved and we see in prompt and comprehensive governmental action a powerful force toward solution. With the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, we believe that, "Only a commitment to national action on an unprecedented scale can shape a future compatible with the historic ideals of American society." 

We therefore urge, most respectfully, by copy of this resolution, the President of the United States, the North Carolina delegation in the United States Senate and the House of Representatives, the Governor of North Carolina, and the North Carolina General Assembly, by giving their executive and legislative support, and by using their public and private influence, jointly and severally, to insure prompt enactment of such legislation as may be necessary to effect an early amelioration and continued progress toward an eventual solution of the economic and social problems of the disadvantaged groups among us. Passed by the Faculty Senate 9 April 1968
