On behalf of the City of Durham, I wish to convey to you the official gratitude of our community for the fine assistance, support and re-assurance received by us from your office during the recent difficulties. 

We want you to know, too, that we are constantly and diligently working on the inherent social problems of our time. We trust that one day our efforts can, without interruption, be directed to the fundamental cause of our civil disorders without using an undue amount of our resources on law enforcement. 

In the meantime, our appreciation again to your office, the good liaison work of Mr. Charles Dunn, the National Guard and the State Highway Patrol. 

Since much is learned from these experiences which may be beneficial and refinements and improvements are always desirable, my office stands ready to respond to your call for such review at any time. 

With kindest personal regards, I remain sincerely
