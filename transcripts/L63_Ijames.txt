I know you are a very busy man, so my feelings will not be hurt if you don't have time to reply to this letter. Just wanted you to know about the feeble efforts of a small man in a small town to promote peace and goodwill in this great State which is so fortunate to have you for its Governor.

Sincerely yours

REASON TO BE SAD, BUT NO REASON TO RIOT, BURN, AND LOOT:

Many compliments have been bestowed upon the late Dr. Martin Luther King since his assassination last week. I dare not ask the editor of this paper to list all of his noble characteristics again, but I am grateful for the privilege to mention his desire for love to reign over hatred, and peace to triumph over violence.

Many of us question the methods and tactics Dr. King used to help mankind, but thousands upon thousands of people throughout the world have admitted that his motive was good. The many things said
about his determination to overcome evil with good tell us that he a man who worked on hot issues with a cool head.

Martin Luther King, Jr. had the idea that all men should be the recipients of justice and freedom, but he also had the idea that no man should seek after his rights with methods that are not right (rioting, burning, looting, fighting and killing). Throughout the land he taught men to lay aside the weapons of violence and strive for their goals with a more excellent way.

Dr. King used many opportunities to practice what he preached. When a crowd of angry negroes (his race and my race too) gathered to retaliate for the bombing of his home in Montgomery, Alabama, - Dr. King persuaded his people to return to their homes and let peace abide in their hearts. His plea for restraint and order carried the message: THIS EVIL DEED GIVES US NO REASON TO RESORT TO VIOLENCE.

The assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. bombed the negro race. All of us feel the effect in one way or another, but I think we need to repeat the message he proclaimed in Montgomery: THIS EVIL
DEED GIVES US NO REASON TO RESORT TO VIOLENCE.

Shame is upon those who used Dr. King's death for an excuse to riot, burn, and loot. Those who rendered such violence took advantage of a sad occasion to display the hatred that was already planted in their hearts. They have admitted to the world that the doctrine of love which Dr. King upheld had no influence on their lives.

Men of all races who deliberately injure the economic, civil, social, physical, or spiritual welfare of their fellow men - admit to the world that they have rejected the example of Him who was greater that Martin Luther King, Jr. Jesus Christ was that greater one who agave the perfect example as He marched along the shores of Galilee. His followers heard Him say: ".....thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself", "love our enemies", and "...as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise". Cruel men misunderstood His example, hated His doctrine, and nailed Him to a cross. His prayer on that rugged cross at Calvary tells us that He refused to hate those who hated Him: "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do"
