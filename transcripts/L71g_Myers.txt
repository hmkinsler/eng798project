You were being quoted in the radio news yesterday (Nov. 14 1968) as saying that you were sending a representative to Swan Quarter, N.C. to get the children out of jails and back in school. Please study the enclosed picture. They don't look like children as such, and aren't parents still responsible for the children? I would suggest that the parents be held responsible for letting their children run wild. 

Respectfully
