Greetings in the name of the Lord God Jesus Christ, God the Son. April 7, 1968, I was in the services of Little Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church, Supply, N.C. and heard the pastor, W.D. Frink say that he had received a phone call from your office, asking him to instruct the people to please refrain from violence. He complied with your request, but he did not need to have done it. 

April 9, 1968 I was in a funeral service, at Cedar Grove Missionary Baptist Church, Supply, N.C. with W.H.D. Flowers, as officiating pastor. He stated that he had received a telegram from your office making the same request. He also complied with your request, but again there was no need for it. 

May I say to you sir, that the Negro people of Brunswick County are not a people given to violence, but they are a peace loving, law abiding, God honoring people. We have not had even so much as one instance of violence committed by any Negro person who is a citizen of Brunswick County. They love the Gospel. 

The K.K.K. membership, that consists of white people, are the violent ones. They are constantly molesting the Negro people of Brunswick County. Brother Flowers said that he had received several threats recently, even to the extent of one man with a shot gun under his arm threatened to kill him if he did not cease to preach as he is preaching. He told him he would have to kill him to stop him from preaching as he is preaching the Gospel of Salvation, Peace and love, nonsegregation and racial equality. 

The K.K.K. it seems can do this, since they have a charter granted to them by the State Government, and the law is helpless or not concerned about curbing the evils that they dot. Their skin is white so that is alright, but just as soon as a Negro undertakes to defend his rights, he is very much in the wrong. 

It also seems to me that you are not too much concerned, as to how many people are killed on the highways by drunken drivers with automobiles, so long as they buy their liquor from the legalized liquor stores. It appears also that you are more interested in liquor revenue than you are of the safety of human life on the streets and highways of the State of North Carolina. 

It is time that the K.K.K. and Alcoholic beverages be outlawed. It is time and past time, that the hooded knights of the K.K.K. be dealt with in a very positive way for the violence that they commit. It is also time and past time that the drunkards driving automobiles on N.C. highways be dealt with in a far more positive way than is being done at present.
