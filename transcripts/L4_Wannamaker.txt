Greensboro is indebted to you for your actions in handling the crisis which confronted us all during the past week. We are particularly grateful for the services of the National Guard and your wisdom in curtailing the sale of alcoholic beverages. 

Again, we are deeply grateful for what you have done for our city.

Sincerely
