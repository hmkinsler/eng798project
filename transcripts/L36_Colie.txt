As the owner of a small private business I was highly disturbed to find that myself, a taxpayer, along with the other taxpayers of North Carolina are paying the salaries of the employees of the consolidated University of North Carolina during the two hours observance of the march in Chapel Hill April 8, 1968 and for the half-day April 9, 1968 for the funeral of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 

Sincerely yours
