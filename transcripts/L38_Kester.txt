As a member of one of the Charlotte Churches sending a telegram requesting passage of Civil Right legislation including Open Housings, I would like to state that I am opposed to the Open Housing Bill. I am also opposed to voting on passage of any Civil Rights legislation until rioting, looting, and lawlessness come to a halt.

The legislative branch of our government has an awesome responsibility to which wisely and conscientiously the passage of laws affecting all citizens and this should not take place during a wave of extreme emotionalism, as is now present following the tragic assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, or any other national figure.

In the telegram sent this week it is stated that these people have been previously silent and left legislation to extreme elements, and that they now feel compelled to speak on the subject of human dignity, decency, and freedom. The Church is a place of worship and for mourning the death of individuals, not a place for politics and sudden emotional involvement in lawmaking. If these same people who signed the telegram go to the polls on election day and make their choices known after careful consideration of each candidate, then they can feel free to write their representatives and make their wishes known in a sincere and rational way.

Sincerely yours
