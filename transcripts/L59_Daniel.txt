As a saddened, concerned and somewhat frustrated American whose racial heritage is Negro, I cannot help but express to you my dismay at the lack of creativeness which you show toward today's problems which are so seriously wounding North Carolina.

Mr. Governor, there simply are not enough federal troops to occupy and safeguard all of America's towns; and, Heaven forbid, even if there were enough, who can be sure that Negro soldiers will continue an allegiance to a system the majority of whose leaders still speak as if "law and order" mean status quo. May the human love and dedication which you seem unable to comprehend but which Negro guardsmen, police and soldiers practice in these dangerous times grow in those men of goodwill. May that growth look over and forgive your constant tendency to overlook their loyalty to these United States of America.

In the meantime, Mr. Governor, you can make some gestures which, though criminally tardy, may so much help even now. Just being noticed would help the corporate feelings of all Negroes in this State. Even as they have already identified variously with white attitudes toward the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Negroes here will beam with pride if you would only appoint a sizeable number of Negroes to some significant state agencies. This gesture will not hurt you, Mr. Governor, but it will help all of us so very much.

Can you imagine for one moment, Mr. Governor, the frustration a Negro youth feels when he sees that his race's most talented men--holding all kinds of terminal degrees from universities all over the nation--can never merit appointment to even a handful of harmless state boards and committees. That gesture can come only from you, Sir.

Force, promise of increasing force, determination to force with force will hardly help us, Mr. Governor. But I urge you to try my suggestion which I make in all seriousness and without malice. Give it a chance, Sir. I cannot be any more wrong than your present course.

Very truly yours,
