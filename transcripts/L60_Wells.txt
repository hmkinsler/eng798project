The past week in North Carolina and throughout our Nation has been, to say the least, a trying time for all persons especially those charged with the responsibility of maintaining law and order.

I feel that you would be interested in knowing that Washington had some minor problems, and at times seemed as if we would have problems to a greater degree. We called your office on the afternoon of April 6, 1968, at which time we talked with Mr. Ragsdale and Mr. Hodges. We advised them of the situation in Washington and doublechecked the procedure for receiving assistance, should circumstances warrant this request. I called your office at approximately 1:00 A. M. April 7, 1968, and advised Mr. Dunn and Mr. Hodges of the situation in Washington. I advised them that we were not requesting assistance, but was passing on information and was seeking assurance that should we need assistance we could receive it through your office. It was reassuring to hear Mr. Dunn and Mr. Hodges say that, should we need assistance, all that would be necessary for us to do was telephone his office. They would in turn contact the local National Guard Headquarters, after which depending upon the local
National Guard officers' recommendations, assistance would be dispatched immediately.

I realize that your office, mine, and others in government exist for the soul purpose of serving those citizens living within our governmental units. I also realize that responsibilities can be carried out with different degrees of enthusiasm. I am saying that I greatly appreciate the courtesies which the members of your staff extended to us and the manner in which they conducted the business of your office while we were communicating with them, Governor Moore Page two April 18, 1968

I hope that the situation never arises where we will actually have to call upon your office for assistance in order to maintain law and order, but should this event occur, I hope that your assistants will handle it in the same manner as they did this past week.

Sincerely
