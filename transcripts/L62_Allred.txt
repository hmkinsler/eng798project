Could you not use your position of leadership in mediating in the present racial distress in the variety stores? Thus far, you have blamed the Negro students as if they were the sole cause of the trouble. Actually, as you surely realize, the discrimination of continued segregation is what has motivated the students to act as they have. 

They are justified morally in asking for service as equals at the lunch counters. May I respectfully request that you move to bring together human relations officials, managers and national representatives of the variety stores, and leaders of the Negro communities affected in an effort to work out in mutual respect for all interests a plan under which the Negro citizens can achieve their full rights? 

Why not do something other than condemn those who are protesting racial discrimination? Yours is a unique opportunity to assert vital leadership for the broadening of democratic principles in North Carolina. I sincerely hope that you will not let the opportunity pass without an effort on your part. I remain your faithful, but puzzled, supporter. 

Sincerely yours
