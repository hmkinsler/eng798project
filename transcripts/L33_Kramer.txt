Now that we've seen that Raleigh in particular and North Carolina as a whole, are not immune to racial outbreaks what will be done about it? The continual calling up of the National Guard and riot police? This creates nothing more than bitter resentment against white authority and it leaves a pervading atmosphere of tension and strife all around. As I rode through Raleigh today, I could sense this embitterment and hostility and it’s a frightening feeling. 

By no means do I condone rioting and violence, but I do not condone social injustice. Martin Luther King's or anyone else's death is no excuse for violence. But should social injustice be met with apathy on the part of those who it is directed against? 

As Governor you must realize that 25% of your constituency is black. Yet, discrimination in schools, housing, interest rates, employment and "public" enterprise still exists. North Carolina isn't any better or any worse than the other Southern States in these discriminatory attitudes and their perpetuation (although we are behind other areas of the country in this respect). Do we get much comfort in this fact? I don't!

Why do the North Carolina legislators persist in overlooking the fact that problems exist? Poverty is quite a widespread disease in this state, but one would never know this by listening to the officials who represent us. I'd say that it is a fair estimation to say that the majority of whites in Raleigh have never seen the deplorable conditions which exist in South Raleigh. The fact that urban renewal will occur doesn't amend the fact that 900 families will be displaced and the proposal for the urban renewal project provides housing for only 450 families. Is there justice in displacing people while not providing a place for them to go. 

This state is so wrapped up in its highway program that it has ignored its human program. But I feel that this is not just an oversight, it is 80% intentional. When is something going to be done? When it's too late?! When mass civil disorder occurs? How many more years will the black man have to wait for justice? I don't think we have too many years left. In fact, I would even call that an exaggeration. Months maybe more applicable. 

It is obvious that something should be done now, not one or two months from now. 

As the political head of this state, you should be able and willing to initiate appropriate legislation to alleviate these injustices. I know this is an easy thing to talk about and to propose, but it had better become an easy thing to do. 

The racial crisis is not a Black problem, it's a white problem. With Martin Luther King as the nonviolent buffer between blacks and whites, there was a chance for peaceful restructuring of our social system. This buffer is gone and the chance of peace is almost nonexistent. This is a white problem because white people control this country and have the power to bring about change. This is a white problem because the Commission on Civil Disorders is correct in its evaluation of the cause of disorder — WHITE RACISM. 

Is there any doubt in your mind that severe injustices have and are occurring? Is there any doubt that quality stands for all men -- not just white men — regardless color?? 

Can you as a State Representative sit back and do nothing?? I hope not! I pray not! Social justice is necessary for this nation to survive. Help it survive!! 

Sincerely
