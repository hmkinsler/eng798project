As you know, the homes of Kelly Alexander, Fred Alexander, Julius Chambers and Dr. R. A. Hawkins were bombed early on November 22, 1965. 

We are aware of your condemnation of the bombing and that the State Investigation Bureau and the Highway Patrol were ordered to find the guilty parties. However, we feel that some safeguards must be made to prevent a recurrence. Useless destruction of property is indeed an evil act and only a miracle prevented the senseless loss of human life. American citizens do possess the right to sleep at night without fear of night attacks. 

We urge you to continue to press for information leading to the arrest of these criminals, even if it means that your state law enforcement officials have to work night and day. The pursuit of justice knows no night or day, justice should always be at work. 

The Lakeview NAACP and indeed all of America is waiting to read in the newspapers, to hear on the radio, to see on television that the perpetrators have been apprehended, brought to justice and received the kind of sentence commensurate to their crime. 

Sincerely yours
