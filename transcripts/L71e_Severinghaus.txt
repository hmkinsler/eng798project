We, the members of the 159th annual meeting of the United Church Board for World Ministries, gathered in Greensboro North Carolina from all parts of the nation, deplore the conditions in our nations and in other parts of the world which give rise to alienation between people and ferment racial antagonisms. Noting the news on the Swan Quarter, North Carolina, situation, we urge that the Board of Education give serious consideration to the grievances expressed by the Black students in regard to the desegregation plan, keeping in mind that genuine desegregation with equality must be a two-way process. 

We deplore the unnecessary use of tear gas: and that the position that reconciliation is more likely to result from sympathetic and just measures than from repressive and forces actions. 

While this situation is of peculiar importance to Swan Quarter, North Carolina, we nevertheless see it as a representation in a significant way determine the course our national will take in efforts towards reconciliation. 

Such incidents not only affect our national unity in a critical period of our history but also affect our image of democracy in the eyes of the world.
