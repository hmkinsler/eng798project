As a voting citizen of N.C. I feel obligated to stand, for clean laws and appreciate our leaders who make and abide by them. 

This terrible disturbance of rioting and destruction of property, and crime of all kinds is destroying confidence for our leaders who are not abiding by their promises. 

We think if there were tests made during these episodes there would be found the majority of the participants high with liquor or dope getting them in a cruel state of mind. 

Raising the curfew attracting so many to get their share in Raleigh was ridiculous. Do you think such an act boosted your popularity as a worthy official needs? 

We cannot hope for anything better when the officials in government uphold the criminal. 

The worshiping and honoring of this Martin Luther King was the most asinine, disgusting act this State has ever witnessed. Had he been so influential with his Ð¾wn race he and the president could have checked the first Freedon Riders since their minds were in the same channel, nothing was done satisfactory. 

Sincerely
