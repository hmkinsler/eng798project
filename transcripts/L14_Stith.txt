I respectfully request that you use the powers of your office to assist in establishing effective channels of communication between the city government and the people of Durham. It is my feeling that the two groups have reached an impasse. 

The events of Thursday, February 15, 1968, in the City of Durham pointed up the tensions which lie just beneath the surface of the city. It is tension which has built up to explosive proportions and broke out in destructive disorder. These tensions still exist, potentially more explosive than before.

A number of people have made statements in response to this event emphasizing the need to maintain law and order and the determination to control any similar outbreaks in the future. However, none of these people addressed themselves to the real causes of the disorder, those things which produce and maintain the tension. Durham is still ripe for disorders because the tension is still here. It needs only a spark to light the fire. Durham is typical of the cities where riots occurred last summer. Each of these: Watts, Newark, and Detroit, according to the chairman of the President's Study Commission on Riots, was triggered by events involving the police. So also was the event in Durham last Thursday.

In none of these cities has there been decisive action by the city government which would ease the tension. Neither has there been any action to ease the tension in Durham. All these cities are as ripe for riots today as they were last summer. Will they be set off again? Will Durham's tensions be triggered again?

My hope is that this will not happen. But this hope can only be realized through decisive action--words will not suffice. Decisive action must be taken to
reduce and eliminate the tensions which exist. The answer is not in increased and more efficient methods of riot control. Controls such as this do nothing to prevent outbreaks but are only effective in putting down disturbances. The threat of punishment will not stop disorders from breaking out. More people may be jailed or killed in a shorter period of time using these methods but the tensions within the city will
continue to rise.

The answer lies in attacking the root causes of the tensions. Of course, these cannot be overcome quickly but will possibly take years of patient effort. A beginning can be made, however, which will greatly reduce the tension. This beginning is to establish truly meaningful communications between the city government and the people of the city.

Once again I ask for your assistance.

Respectfully yours
