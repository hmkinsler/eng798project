Enclosed you will find a reply to your request to your Telegram that you sent to us as Ministers and leaders. We did our best I am glad to say we in Henderson, N.C. keep things very quiet. 

In this proposal you will find just what is needed most in thee United Stats of America.

Please feel free to call on us at any time to help you do a good job.

To whom it may concern:

A request was sent out by the Governor to all ministers, and leaders, asking them to use their influence in appealing to the people for peace and order in this time of confusion, over the death of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 

We will gladly do our best to keep peace and order, but quieting those people down at this point will not solve the problem. 

When a baby cries because he is hungry, jumping and rocking him does not satisfy. It may quiet him for a few minutes, but does not take care of the hungry appetite, so it is with the American Negro today. For 300 years we have been crying for freedom, more out let and justice. We have been given token, rocked with promises, and patted on the back, but no longer has this remained sufficient for us. We must continue our fight for what we call a full freedom. 

President Abraham Lincoln heard our cries at the age of 12 and vowed that he would try to bring an end to it. He lit tho torch and started the trail for which we highly appreciate, but he was killed for his good deeds. 

President John F. Kennedy lit the second torch and stepped out to make a home run for justice, according to the will of GOD, but was shot down like a mad dog in the street. 

Dr. Martin Luther King stepped out with President Kennedy for justice for all people. 

President L. B. Johnson has taken up the trail, that President Kennedy left behind. He has stepped out like a man, and is holding tight to this day, he has tried to give the baby the food it needs to grow a healthy strong body. 

Dr. Martin Luther King called for a non-violent program, and was in the line with the President's march through the country asking for nonviolence, for justice for all mankind, justice that has been promised for hundreds of years, but has not been implemented and for the very cause he was shot down like a dog. The torch cannot trail in the dust, it must shine until Freedom, Justice and Equality prevail for all mankind no matter what nationality, what race, creed or color, because this is the will of our Almighty GOD. 

We must fight to establish the following things. 

(1) To establish full fledge, Democracy, a Government with social equality to all people without respect to race. 

(2) To establish such Government, that there be laws requiring that each Legislative body and every Executive body be integrated of all races that are living under the laws that are made by the bodies. 

(3) That complete equality employment to carried out in all business establishments such as, (A) Fire Departments, (B) All Government Offices, (C) All Mail Carriers both rural and city limits, (D) All Post Offices Clerks, (E) All Highway Road Officers be integrated, according to qualifications, (F) All Trucking Firms, (G( All Farm AAA Officers according to qualifications, (H) All Stores Clerks according to qualifications, (i) To completely abolish any type of discrimination, (J) And last but not least to practice full fledge freedom to all people, regardless to race, creed or color.
