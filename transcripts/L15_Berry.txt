I have been your loyal supporter in your campaigns. I took this stand because I believed you to be a
Sincerely Christian man, and one devoted to the democratic way of life.

I have been deeply hurt by your stand for segregation. Do you think when the Lord examines a man's soul
He is going to ask the color of his skin? Do you think a man's color should deprive him of any whit of human dignity? Do you think when Christ blessed the children that He bothered to inquire into their
ancestry first? Do you think we can preach democracy to others and refuse to practice it ourselves?

I an a twelfth generation Virginian and I love the South passionately but I believe with Lowell that
"New occasions teach new duties;
"Time makes ancient good uncouth.
"We must upward still and onward -
"Who would keep abreast of Truth.

I can only hope that you will examine your conscience carefully, and that you will be able to
reverse your stand on this matter.

Very sincerely care
