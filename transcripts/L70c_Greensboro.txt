Do we, as tax paying citizens of North Carolina, have to put up with the likes of Stokely Carmichael being allowed to speak at our tax supported colleges? There is no questions as to who or what Mr. Carmichael is or as to want his lecture will be on. We are opposed to our tax money being used to support any college that allows such as Stokely Carmichael to indoctrinate our leaders of tomorrow.

We are also opposed to sending our children to an institution which has lowered its standards to allow such as this. We shall never as individuals or groups make any donations to the University of North Carolina or any other college which advocates same. Please understand that our objections are to the character of the individual voters.
