This is to acknowledge your telegram of April 6. 

I can appreciate your sentiments in wishing for peace, order and a harmonious relationship between the races. 

I do regret, however, that your expression of concern did not come before the tragedy and the resulting violence occurred. If it had, perhaps some of the violent acts which took place could have been averted. Your recent efforts toward better human relations, in other words, would have been more meaningful in the early days of your administration. 

Sincerely yours
