Enclosed are close to six hundred signatures on petitions distributed yesterday at a memorial service for Dr. Martin Luther King attended by the townspeople of Chapel Hill-Carrboro. We seek from you and would help support positive action in these troubled times. 

Sincerely

While words, memorials, and other symbolic gestures are necessary means of expressing sentiment, sentiment itself can do very little either to redeem a death or to alleviate our frustration over the situations which precipitated the death of Dr, Martin Luther King. His death can only be truly mourned and his tragedy can only be given meaning when it changes the conditions of the living. When a man is sacrificed to a cause, that death can be redeemed only if his cause gains new life. Present events make it imperative, both for our own sakes and Dr. King's, that we prove through actions that the principles for which he lived are viable and can produce effective changes in our society. With this in mind, we, the undersigned, pledge ourselves and request the Governor of the State of North Carolina to pledge himself to bring about the following goals:

1. To reconvene the state legislature to deal effectively with such questions as open housing, the extension of the federal minimum wage to cover all workers in the state, and the repeal of the right-to-work laws. 

2. To deal with urban renewal and welfare complaints. 

3. To implement the measures suggested by the Kerner Report.
