As citizens concerned with improving human relations in this state, we are deeply disgusted about yesterday's incident at Swan Quarter. The information available so far to us suggests that the Negro school children in Hyde were engaged in peaceful protest when they were subject to tear gas and smoke bombs by state patrolman and local law enforcement officials and then were locked in the poison-filled room. If this is what happened it is clearly inhumane. We urge a full investigation of this incident.
