I am a traveling salesman from Richmond and I spend quite a bit of time in Raleigh selling a line of ladies ready to wear. 

I was in Raleigh this week and frankly, I was a bit puzzled as to why the American Flag flying from the State Capital building was not flying at half mast to honor Dr. King. While I realize that we all have our own feelings about events and situations, it seems to me that things of this sort do certainly provoke bitterness and hate among people, regardless of who these people are. This, to me, is a provocation on your part to stir up the people at this time of extreme danger. I am just wondering why a small thing like lowering a flag to half mast would be so difficult for you to do. Certainly, as a Governor of such a great state as North Carolina, you would want to see, especially at this time, harmony among the races. 

Our great Governor, Mills E. Godwin, ordered all flags lowered here in Virginia to half mast with no hesitation whatsoever. 

It is no secret on my part that I am against the mixing of the races, and I am solidly against the looting violence, and burning that has taken place in the many cities of the country, but I can not see for the like of me why the flag was flying at full mast. The state of North Carolina as in Virginia has a large concentration of colored people and in my mind to provoke any further trouble at this time will certainly place all of us in a pretty dangerous position. I would suggest that you must realize that the time, place, and events today are entirely different from some years ago. What I mean by this is that you must be the Governor of all the people or not be the Governor for any. 

I would appreciate your comments on this. 

Sincerely Yours
