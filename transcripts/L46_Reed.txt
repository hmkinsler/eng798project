That such things as rioting in our streets can pass under the screen of "peaceful March" is disgraceful. Someone is bound to be responsible and in this case it is Martin L. King. And he should have to be responsible for the damages rather than the insurance companies. 

We don't need a commission's report on rioting. Wrongs done in the past can't be paid off, or made up for by "hand outs". The only way to improve our society is to teach and preach that each citizen is a responsible citizen. And "Do unto others as would have them do unto you". We are not all responsible for the riots we had last summer and are expecting. 

If there is no law under which leaders and participators in riots can be prosecuted there should be such a law. 

Why not make it a requirement that a "responsibility paper" be signed by a person, or persons, before a demonstration of any kind can be held. Or better yet have each participator to sign. 

Very truly yours
