Many of icy fellow North Carolinians and I are more than a little disturbed by the lack of leadership in the governor’s mansion during the current racial crisis. But even this last statement is incorrect, because this crisis is more of an economic than a racial struggle. Negroes in the state of North Carolina have suffered under the legacy of three hundred years of slavery and of another one hundred years of second-class citizenship. They occupy an inferior social position because of their inferior economic status. For example, let me bring your attention to recent publications of the North Carolina Fund, to the many unwed Negro mothers visiting Chapel Hill’s Memorial Hospital, and the exclusive use of Negroes in menial positions among UNC employees. A drive through eastern North Carolina is also revealing. 

Rather than prematurely calling out the National Guard and proclaiming a statewide ban on liquor sales, you might in the future attempt to help the Negro economically and educationally in the myriad ways possible at the present time. You must provide the leadership necessary to calm and educate the white community. You must demonstrate that you are not the tool of the "establishment," as many of your critics have charged. North Carolina presently enjoys a unique opportunity to provide for the nation an example of state action to ameliorate the condition of an unjustly oppressed minority. Recent events indicate that the alternative is violence entailing the destruction of lives and property, possibly of society itself. Please do not fail us who take pride in living in North Carolina. 

Sincerely yours
