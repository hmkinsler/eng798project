Thank you for your telegram to the clergy urging our efforts to bring peace and order to our communities. 

I assure you that the clergy of Salisbury and of Rowan County are working diligently to that end. Enclosed is a copy of the bulletin for the Community Memorial Service held last Sunday evening for Dr. King. In a packed and over-flowing church, a congregation that included at least one-third white persons sought to give expression to our unity in Christ. 

I hope, now, that you will use every influence of your Office not only to restore peace and order to our communities but also to deal courageously and immediately with the social causes for the restlessness in the Negro soul today. It seems to me that a similar appeal now to the congregations of our State to work for the rights of all men would offer a great impetus and bring needed prestige to the movement to guarantee to every man the opportunity to develop the full potentials of his humanity. 

Sincerely yours
