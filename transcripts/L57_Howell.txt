I am writing in regard to your recent statements concerning the sit down strikes, law and order, and the conduct of North Carolina college students. Not that what I say will be of any interest to you or affect your views; but I, as a college student and a citizen of the state, would like to express my opinions anyway. 

In connection with your statement that law and order must be maintained in regard to the sit down strikes, I think that one of the most important elements was left out, namely justice. Let us have law and order, but also let us have justice and nondiscrimination along with them for any person. Let us have the laws enforced by justice including the one passed by the Supreme Court of the United States which did away, supposedly, with legal discrimination in public schools. Hitler and Stalin probably had law and order enforced, but they did not consider justice or nondiscrimination. I stand for law, order, justice, and nondiscrimination against any human being in this matter. I surely am not going to fight for a "white supremacyâ€™ idea that is dying or is dead in the modern world, but I will fight for equal rights under law for all human beings. 

Next, if the university and college is a free academic institution dedicated to the search for truth and to the art of learning, a center of free knowledge, what right, I want to know: has the head of such an institution to control the expression of its members on vital issues which will affect their lives as long as they are not speaking for or representing the university in an official capacity. As a member of the human race and as a peaceful citizen of the state, I think it is my right to express my self on issues of concern to me as long as I do not interfere with the right's of others. I go to college to learn and obtain knowledge that will help me in making decisions not to be told what decisions I have to make. A college student should be mature enough to decide some things for himself, especially what prejudices he wants to have, if any. However, I realize that with the sit down strikes there have been conflicting rights at stake. One person's right to run his own business and cater to whom he pleases, and the other person's right, as a member of the public, to be able to buy anything a store sells, including service, if they have the money and the store sells them other things. I only plead for the students' right and the right of all people in a democracy, supposedly, as a thinking human being to express themselves in their own way as long as they do not interfere with others rights.

Sincerely
