We were pleased to have your telegram to the clergy and laity of North Carolina, concerning the death of Martin Luther King, called to our attention and praised by one of our ministers.

Further, we were pleased that in maintaining order in the State with a minimum of force and loss of life you have done the necessary. Maintaining order alone, however, is not sufficient. We, of white America, must now act so that pious words eulogizing Dr. King are followed by forthright steps that will lead to jobs and thus to food, clothing, and decent shelter for unemployed, underemployed, and unemployable persons in this State, both black and white.

It seems to us that your position as a governor who may not seek a second term puts you in an especially strong position to promote bold programs during your remaining period in office. Four years ago you went before the electorate asking to serve them and to receive the prestige and gratifications of the office of Governor. Now, we call upon you to lead the citizens of this State through a period of reconciliation into a better time measured by their well-being.

For example, you have the power to change employment practices in State government, from the stock room and supply service through the Highway Patrol and National Guard, into administrative positions at all levels in all departments; we have read recently of some of your plans in this area, now let us hear of actions. Let us hear, for example, of Negroes being appointed to the judiciary.

Further, let us have some special programs to provide employment, income, training, and thus self-respect, for youth. Let us dip into the budget surplus to provide these things rather than merely to pay for quelling riots and rebuilding after wanton destruction resulting from frustration and emotional action.

We call upon you to press your staff into action; to put programs of this sort into operation within the month and to keep them going and growing throughout the summer and into next year. We call upon you to support the work of economic opportunity groups, helping to redirect them where they can be improved. We urge you to take up the burden of leadership that goes with the governorship and lead the State into a period of cooperation and relative economic advancement for our less well-to-do citizens.

Sincerely yours
