As Gov. George C. Wallace has told us, the anarchist are given top billing by our officials. Gov. Moore, I hold you responsible for the speakers platform given to Stockley Carmichael at Chapel Hill. He runs with a pack of destroyers and you know his record. As Gov. you have the power to avoid our children being thrown to these evil people. God help our children! 
Why do you permit these so called civil rights agitators at Swan Quarter?? Moving in and leading? Trouble. Shame. 
Sincerely
