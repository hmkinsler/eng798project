I was horrified at the ruling of non-segregation which the Supreme Court has ordered. To me, our States Rights have been taken away and we are being dictated to. What next? What else are we going to be told we can or cannot do? 

I am a taxpayer, as many others are in this state, and when we are not given the privilege to say what we can do with the money we are paying for our own children, I think it is high time the South took a firm standi When Negroes can pay their own way, then its time to see what can be done. But as long as the white people are paying for them and keeping them up, they have no right to say what will be done with "our” money! 1/hat ’ s the matter with our government? Are we to be dictated to as the Russian people are having done to them today? We are on the straight road to Communism with no detours I 

I have a two and a half year old boy who will be going to school in a few years, and I certainly do not want him having to go with Negros. I don’t think our Supreme Court or Government knows what they are doing. This thing is going to cause race riots and we are going to be in a worse situation than we are now, if the South lets this thing go any further. It’s all you can do to get a Negro to work and most of the time you can’t get one to work at all! Why should I, and the rest of us, pay for people who want something for nothing and are not even willing to help themselves? I am willing to pay my part for separate schools, as we have done in the past, but until the Negro race is willing to accept full responsibility for citizenship, then they should be grateful for what they are getting. It is an outrage that we have to support them and then have to enter our children in private schools — luring this additional expense. You may be sure that my children will never go to school with them and I shall do everything in my power to keep it from becoming an established fact. 

Mr. Umstead, I hope that you will stand firm against this thing, because I fear for our children if this situation persists. 

Very truly yours,
