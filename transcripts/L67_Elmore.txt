I wrote you about 1 month ago that plans were in the working to take over our college campus. Within the next two weeks, 6 campuses were demanding more rights, more privileges, blocking the administrator's building, holding college presidents hostage, marching en mass in the presidents' home, etc. Then Martin Luther King's death -- and our nation was demanding we pay homage, this man whom violence always followed. Merchants were threatened - our local Negro leaders who have done so much to keep power -- others of our youth were threatened of danger if they did not join them. Threats of burning this house were issued too - Congressmen were threated of violence to themselves and families -- if they did not push the bousing bill and I must say our local negros had more stamina than did Congress - yet we should be humbly proud that our N.C. Representatives did not succumb to these threats -- We do have a great State. 

We must realize that all of us are in as much danger as those threatened for no mob stops to ask questions. And when they rally get down to fussing -- they will take no time to issue threats - but will come like a thief in the night (2 false bomb threats in our schools today). Anything to keep everybody stripped up in the mean time to take our mind off the vital issues. 

So I must repeat again - When this gets started again - burning and looting may seem like a small thing - for whether or not their demands are met - they plan to use our college students - black power - "poverty" youths to overthrow our government and rid us our "imperialist attitude" - Every day now - one or two more colleges and universities and being taken possession of. 

Remember, I stated in last letter that the Student Association President -- Ede Swartz -- had set up outside last Aug and released plans of it in Nov one to remove situations from most campuses -- And that one of our undercover agents had worked as "undercover" agent with the Du Bois club - for 2 years - and that he had given distinct proof of their plans to unite all Leftist groups - and that they planned to spill blood in our streets this summer. I also wrote Congressmen of these facts -- No doubt they plan to do this before vacation begins. 

But as usual we are pessimist, extremist, etc. But call us what you will, we are only facing facts - facts - Gov. Moore, and we do not blame our students or those in office in our country. But we know a foreign conspiracy has been working here since 1917 or 19 and this is definitive proof that agents were here in 1902 -- Laying the foundation work for this group - one of the 1st - Warburg, a banker with Kuhn, Loeb & Co. in NYC. His partner Jacob Schiff was not long in sending $20,000 out to the USSR Conspiracy in USSR - which Warburg instead of banking, spent his time in monetary reforms for the U.S.  - which we know is where are intended collapse began. Can anyone of us relieve our selves of blame if our reforms to read the other side of the coin that has so well been kept hidden??
