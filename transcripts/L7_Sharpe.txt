We commend the law enforcement agencies of Greensboro for those policies which have, thus far, prevented any loss of life in our present crisis.

However, because the presence of the armed National Guard heightens tension and provides a target for violence which might not otherwise occur, increasing the danger to human life,

Because the existence of the National Guard as a riot suppressor and the emphasis upon law and enforced order contrast so harshly with the minimal attention being paid to solutions for human needs, increasing the feelings of frustration and helplessness among the poor,

Because there can be no military solution to urban problems,

We seek the immediate instigation of social and economic programs to improve the conditions of housing, education, and employment among the poor,

We volunteer our cooperation and support for such programs.
