I am glad to read in the papers that you have made a satisfactory recovery and that you are able to be back in your office again. I trust that your health will remain good because, certainly, you will need it and many other sources of strength during the coming six months. 

I, as well as most others, have been considerably disturbed since the Supreme Court decision on segregation. I have given it considerable thought, and especially after reading the stated objectives of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. It seems that the chief objective of that organization is the complete mongrelization of the races, in which case there would be no more white and no more colored. Abolition of segregation in the schools seems to be only a step in their program. 

I do not wish to take anything away from them nor to deprive them of any right of equal opportunity, but at the same time, I feel no obligation to fraternize with them personally or through our children, just to make them feel better. I do not pretend to know just what the outcome is going to be concerning our schools, but if the worst comes to the worst and segregation does have to be abolished in the schools, we have one fort left, and that is separation of the sexes. Under no circumstances, can we in this state ever allow both races and sexes to grow up together in the public schools, to fraternize, and to attend social functions together, because this would gradually eventuate into matrimony and the attainment of their chief objective, mongrelization. The only time to stop that is before it Is too late. Certainly, the Supreme Court could not pass another law and keep us from separating the sexes in public schools. 

I have already talked to Tom Pearsall about this, and I an sure that it is in the minds of many others.

Probably, you had already thought of it long before I mentioned it

With kind regards, I remain Yours very truly
