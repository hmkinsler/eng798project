Аз Jewish Chaplain at Camp Lejeune, I received the telegram which you sent to our Chapel following the tragic death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Your words of concern for peace among men and an end to strife were most welcome. You asked that we who are clergymen sреак to this problem from our pulpits, I can assure you that this was done in our congregation and will continue to be done. 

In order to pursue the goal of closer communion among men of diffrent races, it is obvious that concrete steps must be taken to assure the Negro equal status in every phase of our society from jobs to open housing to education to, if I may say so, open houses of worship. In this regard, I would like to address my congregants in very specific terms. Ahy help that your office can give to me would be most appreciated. Thus, if you could let me know of the legislation which you plan to offer in the coming weeks or months which will be aimed at correcting the problems of racial inequity, I will do all that I can to back such measures before my congregation. 

As a rabbi, I was most happy to зее the obvious interest in racial harmony which your telegram reflected. Knowing how busy your office must be, any response that you can give to this letter will be humbly appreciated.

Sincerely
