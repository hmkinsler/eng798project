I am a concerned and most distressed Mother of four children aged 16, 13, 5 and 7 months old, therefore they attend senior high, junior high and elementary school. 

I am referring to the Supreme Court decision on "bussing" made on Tuesday April 20, 1971, headed of course by you. Have you or do you care to hear the feelings of the common people like myself who have children attending public schools concerning "bussing"? 

Let me make one point clear. Just because I live in North Carolina doesn't mean I'm against integration. For instance, when our children become sick at school, we naturally have to go pick them up. How many children in the poorer areas have parents who can afford to come get their children? Also, nowadays children are engaged in extra activities after school and this means one thing: the parents traveling back and forth. Answer this one, who is going to pay for buses? This money should be used to better and enlarge overcrowded schools. 

It seems apparent to me and every other person I’ve talked with that you are dictated to and possibly being threatened by a handful of NAACP's, Communists and liberals. Its the top people in office today that is tearing our nation and every other nation apart. Its not what the citizens want and need, its always what the top brass wants to dictate. Do you call this Freedom? Do you call this Freedom that my children cannot attend the school of their choice? 

Have you ever talked with children in public schools if they want to leave their friends and neighborhood? I have talked with my three school age children and they say "no”. 

I think the time has come that issues such as this one should be brought to the public to vote on. Then we would have freedom to vote for our wants and needs. This is the only honest and fair way. 

Do you have grandchildren who attend public schools or do they attend private schools? Believe me, this decision is on the lips of everyone I know who has children and dominates over-the-fence conversations at this time, Right is right and wrong is wrong and in my personal opinion this action is wrong as wrong can possibly be. 

Do you honestly and truly feel you have a cloar conscience in your decision on "bussing”? Think about it. 

Sincerely
